      <h2>Iterating a predefined number of times</h2>
      <p>
        BASH offers <code>in {0..5}</code> style of loops which are
        useful if you just want to iterate e.g.: 10 times and
        (optionally) do something with the index variable:
      </p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
for i in {0..9}; do
  echo "i=$i"
done
</pre>
      <h2>Indexed for loops</h2>
      <p>
        If you need a proper indexed for loop where the start and stop
        conditions must be read from a variable, or you want the step
        to be different from one, you'll be happy to learn that BASH
        has a loop constructs which looks very similiar to C-style
        for-loops.

<pre class="prettyprint">
apple_array=("red" "yellow" "green")  
for (( i = 0; i &lt; ${#apple_array[@]}; i++ )); do
  echo "Apple number" $i "is" ${apple_array[$i]}
done
</pre>

#+TITLE: Open Sourcing Widget Framework
#+AUTHOR: Torstein Krause Johansen / Vizrt Online

* First, the focus of WF 2.0
- Improve upgrade-ability
- Stabilise API
- More framework, less widgets

* Putting the source on github
- Typical problem: everyone fixes it in their code repository
- ...and then a new version of WF is released

* Putting the source on github - II
- You can fix the bugs yourself
- Offer pull requests
- Next step: sharing widgets

* What will you be able to do with the open sourced WF ?
- Like now, use it for all your projects
- Both in development and in production

* Choosing the license
- As free as possible (as in beer and freedom)
- Perhaps dual licensing 

* Questions?

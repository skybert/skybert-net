#+TITLE: SaaS: Blistering Fast & Jolly Good
#+AUTHOR: Torstein Krause Johansen / Vizrt Online

* Agenda
- [[Blistering Fast Installation]]
- [[Jolly Good Documentation]]

* Blistering Fast Installation
- Production sites are pretty hard to set up
- ...not mentioning getting them to perform well under high load
- ...and keeping them up to date
- ...and ensure they're easily scalable
- ...and of course not forgetting making them secure

** Blistering Fast Installation - 0
A typical, high traffic Escenic production web site looks like this:
[[./complex-architecture.svg]]

** Blistering Fast Installation - I 
On Debian based systems, install the
=escenic-content-engine-installer= package:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
# curl -s http://apt.vizrt.com/repo.key | apt-key add -
# echo "deb http://apt.vizrt.com unstable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vizrt.list
# apt-get update
# apt-get install escenic-content-engine-installer
#+END_SRC

** Blistering Fast Installation - II
Write your =ece-install.conf= file based on the
[[https://github.com/skybert/ece-scripts/blob/master/usr/share/doc/escenic/ece-install-guide.org][Escenic Content Engine Installer Guide]] or base it on any of the
[[https://github.com/skybert/ece-scripts/blob/master/usr/share/doc/escenic/examples][pre-made examples]] configuration files.

** Blistering Fast Installation - III
With =~/ece-install.conf= in place, let the installer do all the work
for you:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
# ece-install
#+END_SRC

** Blistering Fast Installation - IV
Depending on your selected installation profile(s), network and
machine speed, you should have a working systems a few minutes later.

Let's install a cache server (aka a reverse proxy).

* Jolly Good Documentation
- Customer specific
- Always up to date
- All examples are copy and paste-able
- All links are clickable.

** In the web browser
Let's go to: http://jollygood:5678

** And on the command line
#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ system-info
#+END_SRC

- View the sytem information in YAML
- Or good old HTML
...or even Confluence markup, if that's your fancy.

** VOSA Guide
Nice to read, customer specific, generated documentation.

One book per customer: http://start.vizrtsaas.com/nie

* Summary
- In the SaaS world, we don't worry too much about servers anymore, if
  there's anything, we just re-install them.
- A product of this, is that our automatic installer is getting
  pretty good.
- You've got good, up to date, documentation wherever you are.

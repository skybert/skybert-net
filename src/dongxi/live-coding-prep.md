This is a tale of how I prepared for a 15 minute live coding session
for the [CUE Days 2023 conference](https://www.cuedays.com/).

I wanted to live code a complete CUE CMS system, starting off from a
clean server, installing the MariaDB database, the Solr indexer, the
nginx webserver with CORS configuation, the Javascript application CUE
editor, the CMS itself, Content Store, as well as an SSEP proxy.

I didn't want to cheat like having the database created in advance, or
having the web server configured with CORS. I wanted it to real. And
live. Added to that, I wanted to give a brief introduction as well as
a summary at the end of the installation. That left me with about 12
minutes to do the actual live coding. That was an extremely tight time
frame.

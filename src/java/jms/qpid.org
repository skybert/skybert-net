#+title: Qpid

Qpid is AFAIK not Java, or JMS for that matter, specific. However,
it's in this context I've used it, so I put it in this section - for
now.

** Turning on other security mechanisms

On Debian, quid is set up with only PLAIN authentication. To enable
other security mechanisms you need to do the following:

*** sasl
qpid uses SASL2 for this, so edit its configuration like this:
#+begin_src text
# vi /etc/sasl2/qpidd.conf
#+end_src

Then, change the line starting with =mech_list= and the mechanisms
you want. I just needed ANONYMOUS, so I changed the line to read:
#+begin_src text
mech_list: PLAIN ANONYMOUS
#+end_src

*** qpidd
Change qpid to use authentication:
#+begin_src text
# vi /etc/qpid/qpidd.conf
#+end_src

And be sure to have:
#+begin_src text
auth=yes
#+end_src

Be sure that you have desired permissions in =/etc/qpid/qpidd.acl=, I
just had:
#+begin_src text
# Require explicit authorization to create interbroker links
acl deny all create link

# Allow everything else
acl allow all all
#+end_src

*** Restart the Qpid broker
#+begin_src text
# /etc/init.d/qpidd restart
#+end_src

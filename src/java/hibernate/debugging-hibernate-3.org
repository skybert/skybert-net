#+title: Debugging the full SQL that Hibernate 3 produces

Normally, the best way to debug Hibernate 3, is to add a JDBC wrapper
so that you can see all the SQL that it generates.

However, if you cannot do this, you can attach a (remote) debugger to
your application and step thorugh the code in the execute method
inside the entity action classes.

For instance, to figure out the values that Hibernate puts in its SQL
update statements, check out the =execute()= method in:

#+begin_src text
org.hibernate.action.EntityUpdateAction
#+end_src

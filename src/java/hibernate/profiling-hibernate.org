#+title: Hibernate Profiling 

Starting with Hibernate 3.6.0, you get basic profiling out of the
box. First, set logging on =org.hibernate.stat at least= to TRACE. 

Secondly, set the JVM parameter =hibernate.generate_statistics= to
=true=. That's it, you should now get log entries for all the SQL
queries Hibernate makes, together with execution times and more to
boot.

You'll also get a JMX interface turned on with this so that you can
browse more statistical information in your favourite JMX browser.

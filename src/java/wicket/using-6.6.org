#+TITLE: Changes in Wicket after 1.5

These are some of the changes I've noticed with Wicket, happening
some time after 1.5.x and 6.6.x.

* Input validation
In 1.5 you could use =MiniumValidator= for validating an input
field. Checking that a user doesn't enter an age below 0, you'd do:
#+begin_src java
TextField<Integer> ageField = new TextField<Integer>(0);
ageField.add(new MinimumValidator<Integer>(0));
#+end_src

In 6.6, however, =MiniumValidator= is gone and can use
=RangeValidator= instead:
#+begin_src java
TextField<Integer> ageField = new TextField<Integer>(0);
ageField.add(new RangeValidator<Integer>(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE));
#+end_src

Now, as you can see, I'm catering for _really_ old folks here ;-)

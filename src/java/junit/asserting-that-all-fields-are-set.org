#+title: Asserting that all fields in a Java class is set

Sometimes you want to test that all the fields of an object is
populated by say a factory. Using =ReflectionAssert=, this is easy:

#+begin_src java
import org.unitils.reflectionassert.ReflectionAssert;
[..]
MyObject myObject = factory.getMyObject();
ReflectionAssert.assertPropertiesNotNull("some fields are not set", myObject);
#+end_src

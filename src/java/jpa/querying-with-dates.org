#+title: Querying by Dates

When you want to query by date and not by date &amp; time, it'
important to explicitly tell the query to only consider the date part
of the =java.util.Date=, otherwise, today's entries will always be
ignored since a mere =new java.util.Date()= will return today's time
too, making the query omit all entries that were made between
midnight and the time of day when you run the code.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

#+begin_src java
TypedQuery<Order> query = 
  entityManager.createQuery("select x from Orders x where validUntil >= :today", Order.class);

// will return all entries valid from now, when the code is run and in the future
query.setParameter("today", new Date());

// will return all entries valid today and in the future
query.setParameter("today", new Date(), TemporalType.DATE);
#+end_src

#+title: Getting nice table names with JPA

Nice table names are in my opinion lowercase names with underscores
between the names. For instance, if your persistence Java class is
called =RollerCoasterCar=, I want the table to be called
=roller_coaster_car=. This is easy to accomplish with this bit of
configuration in your =persistence.xml=:

#begin_src nxml
<persistence>
  <persistence-unit>
    <properties>
      <property
        name="hibernate.ejb.naming_strategy"
        value="org.hibernate.cfg.ImprovedNamingStrategy"
      />
    </properties>
  </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
#+end_src

That's it! All your magically generated tables from your Java classes
now look like something a loving DBA would create. Wonderful!

title: Maven doesn't read JAVA_HOME

I was going mad, no matter what I did, `mvn` would not read my Java settings.

Of course, I had done what all articles on the interweb said, setting
`JAVA_HOME` to my preferred Java version, and yes, of course that was
a JDK and not a JRE:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/oracle-java8-jdk-amd64/bin/java
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

The shell was happy with that change:
```bash
$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/oracle-java8-jdk-amd64/bin/java
$ which java
/usr/lib/jvm/oracle-java8-jdk-amd64/bin/java
```

And calling `java` (and `javac`) were all in agreement:
```bash
$ java -version
java_version "1.8.0_144"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_144-b01)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.144-b01, mixed mode)
```

However, Maven was acting up like a grumpy teenager, refusing to use
it:
```bash
$ mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)
Maven home: /opt/apache-maven-3.6.3
Java version: 11.0.9, vendor: Debian, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
Default locale: en_GB, platform encoding: UTF-8
```

As you can see, it somehow picked up one of the other JDKs on my
system, located in `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`.

## strace to the rescue

After some time of fruitless reading of the Maven manual, blog posts
and Stack Overflow posts, I turned to my old trusted friend, `strace`:

```bash
$ strace -e read mvn -version
read(3, "\177ELF\2\1\1\3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0>\0\1\0\0\0\260A\2\0\0\0\0\0"..., 832) = 832
read(10, "#!/bin/sh\n\n# Licensed to the Apa"..., 8192) = 5741
read(11, "JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-j"..., 8192) = 35
```

Aha! When calling the `mvn` command, it `read` something that said
`JAVA_HOME` was the before mentioned JDK 11.

## and some bash
Next up was to debug the `mvn` command itself. Since this was a `bash`
command, debugging it was as easy as calling it with `bash -x`:

```bash
$ bash -x $(which mvn)
+ '[' -z '' ']'
+ '[' -f /etc/mavenrc ']'
+ '[' -f /home/torstein/.mavenrc ']'
+ . /home/torstein/.mavenrc
++ JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
```

There, it was plain for the world (well, me) to see that it read
`~/.mavenrc` which had `JAVA_HOME` set. So, I (or some install script)
had set this once upon a time and I'd completely forgotten about it.

Now, finally, I'm in total control of my Maven runtime environment ðŸ˜‰

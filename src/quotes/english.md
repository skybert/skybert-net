## What Makes a Love Your Love?
<blockquote>

<cite>
"I love you not because of who you are but because of who I
am when I am with you..."
</cite>


An extremely helpful Chinese guy who didn't speak a single
word of English, but spent two hours in the middle of the
night writing down on a piece of paper how I should find my
way out of the chaos I was in. He wrote in Norwegian (!)
using only my Chinese-Norwegian dictionary as guidance. When
we departed, he gave me a notebook onto which he had written
the instructions. 


Looking at the notebook a year later, I discovered this
quote on it. Funny, as I've formulated the very same
sentence when describing why my best friend is my best
friend: because of the way I feel when I am with him. And
this goes for relationships too, it's the way they make you
feel that is the most imoprtant thing when I think of it.

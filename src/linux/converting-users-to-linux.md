title: Converting New Users to Linux

I find the greatest challenge with giving Linux to others, is what
story to tell: You're running Mint. That's a Linux distro. It's based
on a different distro called Ubuntu, which again is based on
Debian. Your desktop, though, is called Cinnamon. So when you have a
problem, you must search for a solution in that order: Cinnamon, Mint,
Ubuntu, Debian.

When installing packages, you have native packages, through apt-get,
but you also have flatpak, snaps and appimage. Graphical frontend?
Sure, you've got (at least) 2 different ones installed. When to use
which? Try them out and see which one you like the best. If they don't
work, try `synaptic`, it's not pretty, but that always works. Oh, but
it doesn't work with flatpak or snaps, so you need to be aware of
that.

Good luck üòÅ

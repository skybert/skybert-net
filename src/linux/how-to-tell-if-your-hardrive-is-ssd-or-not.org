#+title: How to determine if your hard drive is SSD or not

It's easy and elegant on Linux, you can just do:

#+begin_src text
$ cat /sys/block/sda/queue/rotational
1
#+end_src

If it returns =1=, it means no, you've got a conventional, rotating
hard drive. If it returns =0=, you're using an SSD drive.

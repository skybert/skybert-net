I use only one external screen, a [Dell UltraSharp
25"](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-LED-Lit-Monitor-U2518D-Compatibility/dp/B075KGLYRL)
(U2515H) with 2560x1440 resolution. I used to have two screens, then
changed to a super wide screen. These days, I actually find having
one, regular external screen not only sufficient, but also
preferable. There's a certain calmnes of having only one screen and it
gives me more focus.

The keyboard I'm using at work is [Ducky One 2 Skyline
TKL](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-Skyline-TKL). It's
fast and easy to type on. At home, I have my favourite keyboard (and
noisier!), [Happy Hacking Professional
2](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2).

Music is a necessity to concentrate. For about five years now, I've
been enjoying the [Sony
WH-1000XM](https://www.sony.com/et/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4)
series. The sound is good, the noise cancelling adequate and they're
comfortable to wear.

## Operating system

I love [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and use it both for work
and my home desktop computers. Debian is still my preferred server
operating system, but on the desktop, Arch rules supreme.

Arch gives me the latest versions of desktop application and
environments, without seemingly ever to break my system. I upgrade
_all_ the packages _every_ day, but cannot remmeber anything
breaking. It's big feat.

Another thing I dig about Arch, is that I don't need Flatpak, Snaps or
AppImages. Everything's either in the official repositories or in
AUR. I never need to install a package a different way, I just use one
command: [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru). paru deals with
both official and AUR pacakges.

## Desktop environment

For seven years now, I've been using [i3](https://i3wm.org/). I like
it more and more, how it stays out of the way and lets me get on with
my work. It's highly configurable, and I've had a stable setup for
years.

As is normal with i3, I have <kbd>Alt</kbd> +
<kbd>&lt;number&gt;</kbd> shortcuts to jump to any of the 10 virtual
workspaces. I've configured the window manager to always open certain
apps on dedicated workspaces. For instance, my coding editor is always
on workspace `1`, my web browser windows always on workspace `2` and
so on. Thus, I can blindly hit <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd> and be
sure I'll instantly see my browser tabs.

My workspaces are as follows:

1. Editor
2. Web browser
3. Terminals
4. Secondary coding environment
5. Whatever goes
6. Whatever goes
7. Whatever goes
8. Snapshot manager and VPN
9. Music and sound control
10. Personal chat

I prioritise screen real estate, so I have no window decorations, no
toolbar, no notificaiton area, no nothing. The mouse has no use apart
from clicking around on websites ðŸ˜ƒ

Apart from [my i3 configuration
itself](https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/blob/master/i3/config#L1),
the important additions that make i3 great for me are Greenclip and
rofi.

[Greenclip clipboard manager](https://github.com/erebe/greenclip). It
supports both text and images and allows me to have a long history of
copied content that I can choose from when I want to paste it
somewhere else. For instance, I often want to copy 2 things from a
Jira issue when pasting it into Slack: The title and the Jira issue
link. So I first copy both these things from Jira, I _then_ switch to
the other app and invoke Greenclip to select the text I need.

The second taste of secret sauce for my i3 setup, is
[rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi). It gives me fuzzy search
for switching windows as well as launching applications. It being text
based means it's lightning fast too.

    alt="rofi window"
    style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px;"
  />
</a>

With rofi, I get easy asccess to all my open windows, on all desktops.

    alt="rofi window fuzzy search"
    style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px;"
  />
</a>

In this screenshot, I want to navigate to the web browser window where
I'm reading a Wikipedia page. Just typing `wi` quickly narrows it
down, adding `k` makes it unique and I can just hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>
to go to the correct Firefox window.

<a href="/graphics/2025/skybert-rofi-run.webp">
  <img
    class="centered"
    src="/graphics/2025/skybert-rofi-run.webp"
    alt="rofi run"
    style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px;"
  />
</a>

Here showing the rofi dialogue for running an arbitrary
command. There's a also a rofi view for applications, but I like the
run dialogue better as it lets me run any command, like `i3-msg move
workspace to output right` to move the desktop on my screen to the
left, onto the right hand monitor. The rofi run dialogue remembers
previously type commands, making it super fast to use.

Lastly, I like make the desktop look good too, so I use
[picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom) to add translucency to a
selected few of my windows: My editor, my terminals and the simple X
applications, like
[xclock](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/xclock.1.xhtml)
and
[xload](https://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/xload.1.xhtml). You
can find [my picom conf
here](https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/blob/master/picom/picom.conf).

Speed is a big feature of my setup in general. I want it to be
fast. And i3 with rofi and greenclip is indeed fast. It also makes
richer desktop environments not an option for me.

## Coding environment

<a href="/graphics/2025/skybert-emacs-30.1.webp">
  <img
    class="centered"
    src="/graphics/2025/skybert-emacs-30.1.webp"
    alt="Emacs 30.1 editing some files and using magit"
    style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px;"
  />
</a>

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is by my preferred code
editing environment and by far the app I used the most. In the
screenshot above, you can see my Emacs 30.1, with [native
compilation](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Native-Compilation.html),
and skinned using the [sweet
theme](https://github.com/konkrotte/sweet-theme) and the[Source Code
Pro font](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) from Adobe.

I've tweaked my
[.emacs](https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/blob/master/emacs/.emacs?ref_type=heads)
since the year 2000 and have got it about right now, lol.

## Web browser

<a href="/graphics/2025/skybert-firefox.webp">
  <img
    class="centered"
    src="/graphics/2025/skybert-firefox.webp"
    alt="Firefox using the Sweet dark theme"
    style="float: right; padding: 0.8em; width: 30%; max-width: 300px;"
  />
</a>

My primary browser is Firefox. It's fast, has excellent plugin support
and is the browser being the closest [the four
freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html), which I
think is an important aspect.

I find it useful to [pin](http://mzl.la/1BARsAT) the websites I use
the most as this will both load the websites I always need when
starting the browser, and I have a fixed screen realestate to go for
these. The sites I have pinned are: [Slack](https://slack.com) for
chat, [Outlook](https://outlook.office.com) for mail,
[Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) for video chat and calendar,
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/) for PR code reviews and
[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) for research.

Furthermore, I've changed my way of using the bookmark bar. These
days, I prefer it to be visible at all times, and I've added a button
for creating a screenshot since some websites grab the right click,
which is the normal way [to creates
screenshotts](https://mzl.la/3Qwvmfp).

To make it look nice, I use the beautiful [Sweet-Dark
theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sweet-dark/reviews/)
by Eliver Lara.

The plugin [LanguateTool](https://languagetool.org/) helps improving
my writing of English, German and Norwegian alike.

Websites become a lot easier to read, thanks to [uBlock
Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin) blocking
flashy ads.

## Start of the day script

<img
  class="centered"
  src="/graphics/2025/skybert-@home.webp""
  style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px;"
  alt="Running my @home script"
/>

I run one of two scripts every morning:
[@home](https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/blob/master/bash/%40home)
and
[@work](https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/blob/master/bash/%40work). As
you've probably have guessed, I run `@home` when I work from home and
`@work` when I'm in the office. They set up network access, DNS, VPN,
external screens and other things that are dependent on my physical
location. Both of them then call
[@daily](https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/blob/master/bash/%40daily),
which ensures my environment is both ready to use and up to date:

1. Starts an SSH agent
1. Syncs my documents and notes
1. Updates the _entire_ operating system
1. Creates a backup of my most important files that are not version controlled.
1. Creates a start page for my browser. The start page has things like my
   recent Git and Jira history the last couple of days, so that I have
   all I need for the standup meeting later in the day.

    style="height: 30%; max-height: 400px;"
  />
</a>

The command that creates the start page is called `skybert-dash` and
[you can use it
too](https://github.com/skybert/skybert-dash/blob/main/skybert-dash). The
start page looks like this ðŸ‘†

## Keeping up with the news

<a href="/graphics/2025/skybert-elfeed.webp">
  <img
    class="centered"
    src="/graphics/2025/skybert-elfeed.webp"
    alt="Reading RSS feeds in Emacs/elfeed"
    style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px;"
  />
</a>

I get my tech news from two sources: [RSS
feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) and
[Mastadon](https://hachyderm.io/@skybert). Reading RSS feeds with a
good reader, here using [elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) is
super fast and lets me focus on the most important things without
being distractted by animated kittens and other nonsense.

[These are the
feeds](https://gitlab.com/skybert/my-little-friends/-/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/tkj-elfeed.el#L6)
I'm currently subscribed to.

## Music

<a href="/graphics/2025/skybert-mpv.webp">
  <img
    class="centered"
    src="/graphics/2025/skybert-mpv.webp"
    alt="Playing music using the mpv command line client"
    style="width: 80%; max-width: 900px;"
  />
</a>

Although I love Spotify, often times, I prefer playing my local OGG
and MP3 collection using a command line client. I shuffle my entire
collection, ensuring I get a good mix of everything from classical and
opera to hard rock and blues.

```text
$ mpv --shuffle --audio-display=no --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvsocket ~/music/
```

I ask [mpv](https://mpv.io/) to set up a socket to which I can control
it using desktop shortcuts. E.g. to pause, I hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>
<kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>4</kbd>. To jump to the previous track, I hit
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>6</kbd> and to jump to next
track, I hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>7</kbd>. That's it
really. An eternal play list and three shortcuts. That's all I need.

## That's it

Hope you enjoyed this tour of my desktop. Happy hacking!

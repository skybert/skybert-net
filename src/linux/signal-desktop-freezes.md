(signal-desktop:181107): libnotify-WARNING **: 08:44:20.567: Failed to connect to proxy
[181107:1021/084445.667395:ERROR:libnotify_notification.cc(50)] notify_notification_show: domain=1250 code=24 message="Error calling StartServiceByName for org.freedesktop.Notifications: Timeout was reached"
```

This was because I didn't have a notification daemon in my `i3` based
setup. Searching the bug track lead me to [this
issue](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop/issues/4653) which
suggested either disabling notifications in the app, or installing a
notification daemon. Since I find _not_ having notification an awesome
feature of any desktop or phone, I went ahead and disabled the
notifications in the `File` → `Preferences...` dialogue.

An lo and behold, no more freezes.

#+title: Mouse clicks in Linux VirtualBox guest are not registered

I had the problem that my Debian VirtualBox guest did not receive my
mouse clicks, only my mouse movement. I *could* get a round the
problem by removing the VirtualBox guest addons, but that removed both
the shared folders and the improved X/screen resolution, so that
wasn't an option for me.

The problem turned out to be that it had loaded the VMWare mouse X.org
settings. The remedy was thus to replace the vmware settings so that
the equivalent VirtalBox settings could take effect:

#+begin_src text
# rm /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-vmmouse.conf
#+end_src

Then add the VirtualBox mouse settings:
#+begin_src text
# cat > /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-vboxmouse.conf <<EOF
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier      "vboxmouse"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/vboxguest"
        Driver          "vboxmouse"
EndSection
EOF
#+end_src

Then, after restarting X, my Linux guest received my mouse
clicks. Success!

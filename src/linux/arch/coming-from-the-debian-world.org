#+title: Coming to Arch from Debian

Here are some things I've noticed as different and interesting when starting using
Arch after 12-13 years of using Debian GNU/Linux.

* Where's the system logs

There are very few familiar logs in =/var/log=. To know what's going on, you can tail the system log  by using the =journalctl= command:
#+begin_src text
$ journalctl -f
#+end_src

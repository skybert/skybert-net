#+title: Coming to Arch from Debian

Here are some things I've noticed as different and interesting when starting using
Arch after 12-13 years of using Debian GNU/Linux.

* Where's the system logs

There are very few familiar logs in =/var/log=. To know what's going on, you can tail the system log  by using the =journalctl= command:
#+begin_src text
$ journalctl -f
#+end_src


* Finding all files installed by a package
On Debian, =dpkg -S <package>= is a great way of finding the files
belonging to a particular package.

On Arch, the equivalent is:

#+begin_src text
$ pacmas -Qlq <package>
#+end_src

* How to do an apt-get upgrade
Staying up to date on security patches as well as up to date software
packages in terms of features (what you'd do =apt-get update &&
apt-get upgrade= for on Debian) is easily accomplished with:

#+begin_src text
# pacman -Syu
#+end_src

Note that Arch is a rolling release distro, so there's no
differentiation between =apt-get upgrade= and =apt-get dist-upgrade=
in Arch parlance.

To allow KVM guests network access, the whole internet says you just
have to allow incoming and outcoming traffic on the `virbr0`
interface:

```text
# ufw allow in on virbr0
# ufw allow out on virbr0
```

However, it still didn't work. `journactl -f` showed:

```text
# journactl -f

  IN=virbr0
  OUT=wlan0
  MAC=51:50:00:50:64:ce:49:51:00:b1:cd:e9:08:07
  SRC=192.168.122.185

  PROTO=TCP
  SPT=45838
  DPT=80
  WINDOW=64240
  RES=0x00
  SYN

```

This was because there was no firewall rule to _forward_ traffic from
the `virbr0` interface to the `wlan0` interface to get out on the
internet:

```text
# ufw route allow in on virbr0 out on wlan0
```

With that in place, my KVM guests could access the internet as normal!

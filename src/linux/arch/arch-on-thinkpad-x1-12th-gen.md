## Create USB disk to boot the installer from

First, I downloaded the ISO with a torrent obtained from
https://archlinux.org/download/. I used BitTorrent client
[Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/).

I then used [dd](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dd.1.html) to
write the ISO to the flash drive. I figured out the `/dev/<device>` by
running `dmesg` as I plugged in the USB disk:

```text
# dmesg
..
[40163.683166] usb 3-7: new high-speed USB device number 18 using xhci_hcd
..
[40166.445458] sd 0:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI removable disk
```

The `sda` bit was all I needed, I could then run `dd` to write the
file to the disk:

```text
# dd bs=4M \
     if=tmp/archlinux-2024.05.01-x86_64.iso \
     of=/dev/sda conv=fsync \
     oflag=direct \
     status=progress
```

## Getting X1 to boot from the USB

Enter the BIOS/UEFI by hitting <kbd>F2</kbd> (or <kbd>Esc</kbd>, I
hammered on both of them) to enter the BIOS/UEFI configuration and
disable Secure Boot (which requires the OS to be signed my Microsoft's
key.

Then reboot again and hit <kbd>F12</kbd> to get the boot menu. From
there, select the USB disk.

## Let the fun begin

On my old computer next to the new one, I had the [Arch Linux
installation
guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) which
steps you through the different commands you must type to get the bare
boned OS installed.

### Network in the installer
I set up the wireless card with:
```text
# iwctl
station wlan0 connect my-ssid
<pasword>
exit
# dhclient -v wlan0
```

### Partioning the harddrive

```text
# cfisk /dev/nme0n1
```

### Full disk encryption

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_an_entire_system#LUKS_on_a_partition

I opted for the bootloader I've used the last 15 years,
[GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB). I did forget to
[Generatethe main GRUB configuration
file](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#Generate_the_main_configuration_file),
so be sure to do that.

## Boot loader

```text
# pacman -S grub efibootmgr
```

First, get the UUIDs of the encrypted partition, `/dev/nvme0n1p2`, and
the decrypted, mounted partition, `/dev/mapper/root`:

```
# blkid
/dev/nvme0n1p1: UUID="D0BB-3264" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat" PARTUUID="26cb7637-9a3e-4be1-b477-07af31946dee"
/dev/nvme0n1p2: UUID="0ac79fb6-12f5-4d7b-9501-f7c185f94c00" TYPE="crypto_LUKS" PARTUUID="3300b64d-1e98-443f-a59e-8c9fae104d21"
/dev/mapper/root: UUID="4941d62c-51af-4dbb-8390-51f83411edec" BLOCK_SIZE="4096" TYPE="ext4"

```

In `/etc/default/grub`, edit these two variables:
```conf
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3
cryptdevice=UUID=0ac79fb6-12f5-4d7b-9501-f7c185f94c00:root
root=/dev/mapper/root"

GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK=y
```
Note, the `cryptdevice` is UUID of the encrypted partition itself, whereas what's in `/etc/fstab` is the UUID of the decrypted and mounted partition:
```
$ grep ext4 /etc/fstab
UUID=4941d62c-51af-4dbb-8390-51f83411edec / ext4 rw,relatime 0 1
```

Every time after editing `/etc/default/grub`, re-generate the runtime conf:
```text
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

In the generated `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, you can see the two UUIDs of the encrypted disk, `0ac79fb6-12f5-4d7b-9501-f7c185f94c00`, and the decrypted block of the root partiation, `4941d62c-51af-4dbb-8390-51f83411edec`:

```
	linux	/vmlinuz-linux root=UUID=4941d62c-51af-4dbb-8390-51f83411edec rw  loglevel=3 cryptdevice=UUID=0ac79fb6-12f5-4d7b-9501-f7c185f94c00:root root=/dev/mapper/root
```

The final step, is to install the bootloader binary itself.  Normally,
you only need this comamnd once, this is to install the grub boot
loader binary into the right place on the disk. Whatever you put in
`--bootloader-id` will show up in the UEFI/BIOS in the computer as
well as in the machine boot menu that you typically access with
<kbd>F12</kbd>

```text
# grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=Arch
```

## No sounds

Got a vital clue from:
```
$ journalctl -b
```

which said (search for both `snd` and `sof`):
```
May 31 09:31:27 mithrandir kernel: sof-audio-pci-intel-mtl 0000:00:1f.3: hda codecs found, mask 5

May 31 09:31:27 mithrandir kernel: sof-audio-pci-intel-mtl 0000:00:1f.3: error: sof_probe_work failed err: -2
```

I was sure I had already installed `sof-firmware`, but you know what?
I hadn't! This was shortly remedied with:

```
# pacman -S sof-firmware
# reboot
```

## Fonts in Emacs

To get the fonts for the nice icons on the mode line that
`doom-modeline-mode` puts on, I had to install the package:

```
# pacman -S ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono
```

## LSP in Emacs

<kbd>M-x lsp-mode RET</kbd> gave the error:

> make-process--with-editor-process-filter: Doing vfork: No such file
> or directory


I found no good way of getting Emacs or `lsp` to tell me exactly
_what_ wasn't found, so I had to bisect my `.emacs` manually. It
turned out that

```lisp
(setq lsp-java-java-path "/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk/bin/java")
```

Pointed to a non-existing JDK. After installing the needed version,
LSP worked as it should. I've [suggested an improvement in
lsp-java](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-java/issues/479) to help
future Emacs users.

## Firefox cannot display Chinese characters

Both Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese characters showed up
as boxes:

<img
  class="centered"
  src="/2024/firefox-missing-chinese-fonts.png"
  alt="Firefox showing text where Chinese characters are showed as boxes"
/>

Installing this font:

```text
# pacman -S wqy-microhei
```

and restarting Firefox resolved the issue. I can now read Simplified
Chinese and Traditional Chinese to my heart full content.

## libvirtd / virt-manager VMs don't get IP

Turns out `dnsmasq` wasn't running:

```text
# systemctl status dnsmasq
Ã— dnsmasq.service - dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dnsmasq.service; disabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Mon 2024-06-10 09:33:37 CEST; 1min 2s ago
..

```

Starting it again gave a clue:
```
# systemctl start dnsmasq
# journalctl -u dnsmasq -f
..
Jun 10 09:38:24 mithrandir dnsmasq[29904]: failed to create listening socket for port 53: Address already in use
```

Indeed:
```text
# netstat --tcp -nlp | grep 53
tcp        0      0 192.168.122.1:53        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1967/dnsmasq
```

So I'd better close that one down. but first, I wanted to find out
_what_ started it:
```text
$ ps -u -p 1967
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
nobody      1967  0.0  0.0  13916  1968 ?        S    Jun07   0:00 /usr/bin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/defaul
```

Now, *that* looks very daemony, running as user `nobody` and all, but
that's something of [a relic from
LSB](https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/usernames.html)
and with systemd, running with `DynamicUser` is a better option (or
indeed any dedicated user, to ensure that the same user, no matter how
unprivileged, is shared across processes).

Killing that method with:
```text
# kill -9 1967
```

And starting `dnsmasq` again, looked so much better:
```text
# journalctl -u dnsmasq -f
..
Jun 10 09:47:01 mithrandir systemd[1]: Starting dnsmasq - A lightweight DHCP and caching DNS server...

Jun 10 09:47:01 mithrandir dnsmasq[31223]: read /etc/hosts - 0 names
```

The VM didn't get an IP via DHCP directly, so I tried retarting
it. Still no cigar. Then, I tried to restart `libvirtd` itself:

```text
# systemctl restart libvirtd
```

I thought I was homefree, but alas:
```text
# journalctl -u libvirtd -f
..
Jun 10 09:50:28 mithrandir systemd[1]: Started libvirt legacy monolithic daemon.
Jun 10 09:50:29 mithrandir dnsmasq[31614]: failed to create listening socket for 192.168.122.1: Address already in use

                                            dnsmasq: failed to create listening socket for 192.168.122.1: Address already in use

```


I then got an idea: Perhaps the `dnsmasq` service should be disabled? Since it looks like `libvirtd` is a service that starts multiple services, including `dnsmasq`:
```text
# systemctl stop dnsmasq
# systemctl disable dnsmasq
# systemctl restart libvirtd
```

Now, that looked better:
```text
# journalctl -u libvirtd -f
..
Jun 10 09:55:01 mithrandir systemd[1]: Started libvirt legacy monolithic daemon.
Jun 10 09:55:02 mithrandir dnsmasq[32243]: started, version 2.90 cachesize 150
..
Jun 10 09:55:02 mithrandir dnsmasq-dhcp[32243]: DHCP, IP range 192.168.122.2 -- 192.168.122.254, lease time 1h
Jun 10 09:55:02 mithrandir dnsmasq-dhcp[32243]: DHCP, sockets bound exclusively to interface virbr0
```

But my VMs were _still_ not getting an IP.

It turned out my firewall was in the way. On my VM, I checked if I
could access `dnsmasq` on the host machine:

```text
$ nc -zv 192.168.122.1 53
^C
```

Thus, I needed to punch a hole in my firewall to allow VMs on my
`libvirtd` created network to request IPs from `dnsmasq`:

```text
# ufw allow from 192.168.122.0/24 to 192.168.122.1 port 53 proto tcp
```

Now, my VMs could finally request access the DHCP server:
```text
# nc -zv 192.168.122.1 53
Connection to 192.168.122.1 53 port [tcp/domain] succeeded!
```

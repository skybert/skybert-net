#+title: Writing an ISO image to a USB drive from the command line

This is one of my absolute favourite things on Linux: how to easily write
an ISO image of a CD/DVD to a USB drive in a matter of a few key strokes:

#+begin_src text
dd if=/tmp/dvd-image.iso of=/dev/sdc
#+end_src

That's it. That's all. But beware, before doing this, be sure that =/dev/sdc=
is in fact your USB drive ;-). Normally, a mere =fdisk -l /dev/sdc= should
give you enough information to determine this.

/Happy hacking!/

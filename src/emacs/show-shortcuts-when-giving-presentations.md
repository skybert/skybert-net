When you give presentations in which you use Emacs, other Emacs users
would like to see the shortcuts you're using so that they can learn
from you and your setup. The most famous mode for this is
`command-log-mode`, however a more colourful, and in my opinion better,
alternative exists in `interaction-log-mode`.

This wee screeencast shows how it works and how you can keep the
interaction-log-mode buffer open no matter what operations you or your
plugins do in Emacs, including <kbd>C-x 1</kbd>.

Enjoy!

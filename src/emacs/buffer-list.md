title: An turbo charged buffer list

I'm experimenting using `helm-mini` instead of the standard
`list-buffers` command for listing the buffers open in Emacs. The
advantage of `helm-mini` over the default option is apart from pretty
colours, fuzzy regexp matching of buffers.

For instead, here I filter the open buffers to only show anything
related to shell scripts:

#+title: A handful packages that will turbo boost your Emacs

Whatever you use Emacs for, you'll definitely want these packages set
up to get blistering fast code and file navigation.

* Blistering fast M-x
Install [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Smex][smex]] and you'll never look back. It makes you so much
faster in Emacs as it not only auto completes whatever you do with
=M-x=, but it also remembers what you did previously, listing often
used commands at the top.

* Out of the box IDO setup for all your project
Install [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Projectile][projectile]] and get automatic setup of IDO for all your
projects.

Projectile will also give you other project specialised features such
as:

- searching for a string inside your project using =projectile-grep=,
  I use this all of the time, quite seldom, I venture back to
  =grep-find=.

- replacing a string in the project

All of this for free. No setup required.

While you're at it, also consider installing these packages for
an even better IDO experience:

* Find file at point
It's a breeze navigating referenced files in your configuration files
using the built-in =find-file-at-point=.

* Word completion
In addition to the built-in =dabbrev-expand= which will expand any
word, I recommend that you install the excellent =auto-complete=
package and turn it on in all modes. It gives you a nice intellisense
like menu where you can auto complete any word/method name that you
have in a buffer.

* Sentence & block completion
The built-in =hippie-expand= will let you auto complete previously
written blocks of code, or indeed sentences.

* Summary
With these packages in place, you will dramatically improve the speed
with which you fly through your Emacs windows and buffers!

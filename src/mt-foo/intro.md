## Introduction
What does it take to become a programmer? The easy path is to take a
3-5 year computer science degree at a university. But what if you
don't have the possibility for doing this? What if you either don't
have the time, cannot afford it, don't have the grades or requirements
for entering such a course or you live in an area where there's no
such course at all?

Climbing Mt. Foo is my answer to these questions.

## Introduction
What does it take to become a programmer? The easy path is to take a
3-5 year computer science degree at a university. But what if you
don't have the possibility for doing this? What if you either don't
have the time, cannot afford it, don't have the grades or requirements
for entering such a course or you live in an area where there's no
such course at all?

Climbing Mt. Foo is my answer to these questions.

My aim is to create an easy introduction into the technologies I deem
essential for becoming a coder while at the same time don't dumb it
down. I use the correct terminology where ever I can and ensure to
provide pointers so that the student can explore and learn more on the
subjects.

Mt Foo also teaches some of the culture surrounding coding, whenever
you see the theatre masks, ðŸŽ­, there's a piece of programming or
system administration culture to learn. Here's one:

## Why it's called "foo" ðŸŽ­

Whenever coders need some example data, a name or just a string of
text, there are some words that you'll see all over the place:

Foo is the top one. And if there are three values, they're often `foo`,
`bar`, `baz`.

If there's an example numeric value, it's often `42`. This is a
reference to the book [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)
and ["The answer to life, the universe and
everything"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything_(42)).

HTML is a language you use to create web pages.  Today, we'll create a
web page that says "Hello world" in big letters. 

## #0 Elements & tags
When you write HTML code, you write one or more `elements`,
e.g. (`<body>`). These are also called `tags`, although the `<` is
also a tag so it can get confusing. In this course we'll thus use
`element` to mean `<body>` and `tag` to mean `<` and `>`.

There are two kinds of elements: block level elements that can contain
other elements (e.g. `<html>`)  and inline elements that only can
contain text (`<h1>`).

## #1 Create a file called hello.html

In your editor, create a new file and call it `hello.html`. 

## #2 Add the html element

```html
<html>

</html>
```
## #3 Add the body element

```html
<html>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```
## #4 Finally, add the h1 element.
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello world</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

That's it. You can now open your browser, e.g. Firefox, and open the
 `hello.html` file to view the result. Congratulations, you've now
 made your first web page!

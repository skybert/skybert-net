## Paragraphs - p

```
<p>
  This is a whole paragraph of text.
</p>
```

The whitespace inside the paragraph doesn't matter.  It will be all
printed on one line in the web browser.  If the line is too long, the
web browser will wrap it for us.

## HTML - Element attributes

All HTML elements have some attributes you can add to provide more
meaning to them. Attributes are written after the element name, but
inside the tags (`<` and `>`). Here we've got an attribute called `id`
on the `p` tag we created above so that we can easily identify it:

```html
<p id="my-first-paragraph">
  This is a whole paragraph of text.
</p>
```

## Links - a

Linking to other web pages are done with `<a>` element. The `a` stands
for `anchor` ⚓. To link from your `hello.html` page to another page
called `world.html`, you do:

```html
<a href="world.html">Click here to go to world.html</a>
```

Try this for yourself: create a new file called `world.html` and write
something inside it. Now, in `hello.world`, add the link above. When
you click on the link in your browser, you should end up on the
`world.html` page.

The important bit here is the `href` attribute. This can be just a
file name like above or a complete web address. This is how you create
a link that will take the user to Google:

```html
<a href="http://google.com">Click here to go to google.com</a>
```

## HTML - Empty elements

Some elements are empty. That means they neither contain any other
elements nor do they contain any text. If they're empty, we close them
in the start element itself like this: `<br/>`.

## Images - img

```html
<img
  src="fish.jpg"
  alt="Tihs is a picture of a blowfish"
/> 
```

## Lists - ol, ul & li

There are two kind of lists: ordered lists (with numbers) `<ol>`, and
unordered lists (with dots) `<ul>`. The list items in both kind of
lists are inside list item elements, `<li>`.

These items will have a number in front of them, 1, 2 and so on:
```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ol>
```

While these items will have a big fat dot in front of them:

```html
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
</ul>
```

## Well done

That's it, you've now learned to create a fairly rich web page with
head lines, paragraphs, images, links and lists. Next, we'll learn how
to make the page look good too by using another language called CSS
(cascading style sheets).

<img
  src="/graphics/2018/mt-foo/html/02.png"
  alt="Example screenshot of code and result"
  class="centered"
/>

## Exercise

Create a web page for a food recipe. It should have a head line, show
a picture of the dish, list the ingredients and have numbered step by
step instructions on how to prepare the dish.

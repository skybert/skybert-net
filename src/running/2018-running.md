Being a parent to a one year old doesn't leave a lot of time to
train. However, I've managed to squeeze in some good runs on a few
Sundays through the forest.

Also, when the wee man started nursery school, I figured out that I
could run from the nursery to work a couple of days a week and on the
day I work from home, I can manage to squeeze in a jogg in the
forest after dropping him off in the morning.

In May, I took part in the Holmenkollen relay race here in Oslo. Here,
relaxing before my leg.

After catching my breath, it's time for a selfie!

Holmenkollen is such a great event. The whole city is full of runners.

Love my [Altra Superior running
shoes](https://www.altrarunning.com/shop/trail/superior-35-alm1853f). They're
zero drop with low stack, giving superb feel when running through the
woods. This is my second pair.

Needed some jogging shoes that could take some rain and since I've
become pretty much addicted to Altra shoes, there weren't that many
more options than [Altra
Timp](https://www.altrarunning.com/shop/shoes/timp-trail-alm1757f) ðŸ˜ƒ
The stack height is higher than the Superior adding tons of
cushioning, making me feel like I'm running on clouds!

The lunch at at the [Sinober](http://sinober.no) cabin was
glorious!

Some of the best runs in the forest is when it rains or it just has
been raining. The forest smells amazing.

Beautiful autumn colours in the forest.

Running through Edinburgh, Scotland. Here, I'm just outside the castle
gates.

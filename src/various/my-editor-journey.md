## 1991 - edit

[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor) on [MS
DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).

## 1993-1999 - Notepad

[Notepad]() on Windows 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, NT 4.

I also used specialised editors for certain tasks, like [Front Page]()
and .. for HTML.

## 1999-2000 - UltraEdit

During my first year, year and a half in univeristy, I came to like
[UltraEdit]() quite a bit. In my first semester, we learned Visual
Basic, so I used that, of course, but used UltraEdit for everything
else.

I used UltraEdit more and more and quickly ditched [JBuilder]() for it
when we started learning Java in the second semester. I quickly
decided I could do without fancy auto completion when I had a better
editing experience.

## 2000 - Pico

In the very beginning of my Unix journey, I used [pico]().

## 2000 → current - Emacs

[Emacs]() 




## 2004 → current - IntelliJ IDEA

Although I use Emacs about 99% of the time, I *do* use IntelliJ for
debugging Java code. Its debugger is still *way* ahead of anything
I've tried in Emacs.

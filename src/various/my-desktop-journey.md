Major milestones in my Linux journey. Writing this down for my own
amusement, perhaps someone else will find it interesting as well.

## 1999 - started using Linux
Distro: RedHat 6.1
Desktop: GNOME 1
Shell: BASH

## 2000 - started using WindowMaker
Distro: RedHat 7.0
Desktop: WindowMaker
Shell: BASH

## 2001 - started using Debian
Distro: Debian
Desktop: WindowMaker
Shell: BASH

## 2003 - started using fluxbox
Distro: Debian
Desktop: fluxbox
Shell: BASH

## 2014 - started using Arch
Distro: Arch
Desktop: fluxbox
Shell: BASH

## 2015 - back to Debian
Distro: Debian
Desktop: fluxbox
Shell: BASH

## 2018 - started using i3
Distro: Debian
Desktop: i3
Shell: BASH

## 2019 - starting using ZSH
Distro: Debian
Desktop: i3
Shell: ZSH

After 20 years of using BASH, I switched to ZSH. The feature that won
me over was the [auto suggestion/completion
overlay](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) as it
drastically speeds up the typing of long commands.

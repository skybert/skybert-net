Major milestones in my Linux journey. Writing this down for my own
amusement, perhaps someone else will find it interesting as well.

## 1999 - started using Linux
Distro: [RedHat 6.1 "Cartman"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux)
Desktop: GNOME 1
Shell: [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 2000 - started using WindowMaker
Distro: [RedHat 7.0 "Guinness"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux)
Desktop: [WindowMaker](https://www.windowmaker.org/)
Shell: [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 2001 - started using Debian
Distro: [Debian 2.2 "Potato"](https://www.debian.org/)
Desktop: [WindowMaker](https://www.windowmaker.org/)
Shell: [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

WindowMaker. The app in the upper right hand corner is a wee3D app I
wrote in university using C, OpenAL and OpenGL.

## 2003 - started using fluxbox
Distro: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
Desktop: [fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)
Shell: [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 2014 - started using Arch
Distro: [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)
Desktop: [fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)
Shell: [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 2015 - back to Debian
Distro: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
Desktop: [fluxbox](http://fluxbox.org/)
Shell: [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 2018 - started using i3
Distro: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
Desktop: [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
Shell: [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## 2019 - starting using ZSH
Distro: [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
Desktop: [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
Shell: [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/)

After 20 years of using BASH, I switched to ZSH. The feature that won
me over was the [auto suggestion/completion
overlay](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) as it
drastically speeds up the typing of long commands.

## 2022 - back to Arch
Distro: [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)
Desktop: [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
Shell: [ZSH](https://www.zsh.org/)

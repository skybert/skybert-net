title: How Outlook has made me dislike email

After using the [GMail](http://gmail.com) web client and
[Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs)/mu for two decades, I've always
considered email something snappy and accurate. Something I can deal
with exactly the way I want to. Categorising, archiving, labelling and
searching has been fast and powerful. Composing emails has been a
comfortable and distraction free writing experience.

Now with Outlook, this has all changed:

- Bloated
- Sluggish web interface
- Evolution native app is much better, but still, it's like going back
  15 years.
- Search is mediocre.

Email has become something I don't enjoy one bit. I just skim
through. Read as fast as I can, and if I'm to write anything, I opt
for the shortest possible answer, like "OK!" and "Thanks!". Mail has
become little more than a rubbish bin for organisational spam.

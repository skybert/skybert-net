Power Point Architect (n.)<br/>
Pronunciation: <em>/ˈpaʊə pɔɪnt ˈɑː.kɪ.tekt/</em><br/>
Abbreviation: PPA

1. colloquial. A person who has never contributed code to a software
   product but who makes or influences high-level architectural
   decisions that affect the design, development, and maintenance of
   that product, through presentations, meetings, and Power Point
   slides rather than working code.

Compare: software architect, system architect, technical architect.

Note: A Power Point Architect is distinct from a Software Architect—an
experienced developer who has contributed substantial code to the
product and has transitioned to focus on system design, interface
specifications, and technical communication. Such architects are
typically guided by best practices as outlined in texts such as [97
Things Every Software Architect Should
Know](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9780596800611/)
(Monson-Haefel, R., 2009).

<!--
[Thomas Malt](https://twitter.com/thomasmalt) for showing me that the
smartest people in the room are the ones who dare say "I don't
know". Oh and for showing me how to treat daunting problems as mere
challenges to be overcome.

[Cirstyn Bech-Yagher](https://twitter.com/cirstyn) for setting a prime
example of how to be a project manager. How to inspire, never waver
from your goal and care for your team. She's lives what [Getting to
Yes](https://www.williamury.com/books/getting-to-yes/) advocates: Be
tough on the problem, soft on the people.

[Lars Thomas Hansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larsthansen/) for
teaching me that spec is king, keep the fluff out and be careful of
proclaming you know something just because it seem obvious to you.

[Achim Abeling](https://twitter.com/banapple_de) for showing me how you
can work with 100% intensity the whole day, Monday to
Friday. Continuously finding ways to deliver value to your company and
improve yourself.

[Jörn Lehmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joernlehmann/) for setting
a stellar example of how to be a consultant: Equally strong at coding,
teaching, discussion and dealing with customers. Always professional
and with good humour to boot.

[Erik Mogensen](https://twitter.com/mogsie) for always giving a new
perspective, a new thought or idea on how to solve a problem. And for
being an excellent example that a guru doesn't have to be a
condescending knob.

[Roland Mohrbacher](https://www.roland-mohrbacher.de) for always being
calm amidst high preassure, for listening before you talk and of
course, for re-phrasing my rudimentary German into beautfully rich and
correct Deutsch.

[Christian Hamburger Grøngaard](https://twitter.com/christianhg) for
an amazing positive, pro-active attitude. Always seeking to understand
and improve. Constantly trying to make everything better. Code,
workflow, UX, design. And lots of good laughs, of course.

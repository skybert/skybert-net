These are the books I've read in 2018.

## Novels

**De fems tegn**, Hans Olav Lahlum: Great read.

**Et hummerliv**, Erik Fosnes Hansen: Fosnes Hansen is my favourite
Norwegian author, but this novel was a huge disappointment. Long
winded and boring.

**A Clash of Kings**, George R. R. Martin

**Silmarillion**, J. R. R. Tolkien: Second attempt to get through this
book, this time I succeeded. Lots of good, loosely coupled stories
with beautiful language, but heavy going and out right boring at
times.

**The Children of Hurin**, J.R.R. Tolkien: Captivating read, but the
ending is sad like a Greek tragedy.

## Learning things

**Kroppsspr√•k**, Petter Schjerven

**The Obstacle is the Way**, Ryan Holiday 

**Together is Better**, Simon Sinek 

## Still reading as I head into 2019
**Tenke, fort og langsomt***, Daniel Kahneman

**Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution**, Steven Levy

Using the excellent Python Bolt API from Slack, I show how you can
create an app that answers questions posted in any channel.

The video shows how to register an app using web sockets, how to grant
it appropriate access rights, how to bootstrap your Python project,
wire up your app to work with the Slack app you've just registered, as
well as how to navigate the Block format returned from the Bolt API,
answer messages in threads and last but not least, looking up the
answers to questions.

Happy hacking!

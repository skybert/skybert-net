These are some of my memories after three days of awesomeness at
[O'Reilly's Open Source Convention](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-eu-2015),
OSCON, in Amsterdam 2015.

## People

The best thing about going to OSCON was the people I got to talk
to. It's great to speak to people that write the software that you've
used for ages and it's inspiring to meet fellow tribesmen from afar.

Among others, I talked to people from [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org),
The Document Foundation/[LibreOffice](http://libreoffice.org), Drupal,
[Github](http://github.com), the [Perl](http://perl.com) community,
O'Reilly (of course), Gitlab and [Purism](https://puri.sm/). There's
so much going on in the open source world, so much dedication and
passion for creating open source software and meeting some of these
hard working people is nothing but inspiring.

Compared to a conference like [JavaZone](http://javazone), the free
and open source profile at OSCON is much stronger. People are a lot
more aware of what goes on in the FOSS scene and the geek factor are a
couple of notches higher. It's great to be a place where it's natural
to ask if and what open source project people are involved in.

Another notable aspect of OSCON was that the speakers were experienced
presenters. They knew how to address an audience and were used to
adjusting their material to a large room with an audience.

Glancing at people's laptops showed a good number of people running
Linux natively, something which always gives me a warm fuzzy feeling ðŸ˜ƒ
I also bumped into fellow Emacs users, but didn't get much time to
exchange tips as there were just too many good presentations!

## Venue

The venue was the RAI conference center outside Amsterdam and it
served OSCON well. The staff was professional and plentiful, there
were always more than enough people everywhere; at the check-in
counter, at the food stalls, in the reception area, outside the
lecture rooms keeping track of time left for the speakers, in the
hallways guiding attendees in the right direction and even telling you
where the lunch queue was the shortest ðŸ˜ƒ

I've never been to a conference that was so well marked. As a visitor
you were welcomed and guided by signs the moment you got off the
train. They had even set up actual street signs just for this three
day conference!

There were lots to like about the venue, the wifi was spotless (how
often can you say that at such a big conference?) and there were lots
of electricity outlets were the audience were sitting in the lecture
halls. The food was good and plentiful and when the queues were too
long, they even came serving us while we were waiting in line (!). Way
to go, RAI!


## Sonic Pi

The keynotes were generally really good, but one was in a class of its
own: [Sam Aaron's](https://twitter.com/samaaron)
[live coding with Sonic Pi](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-eu-2015/public/schedule/detail/46068)

<iframe style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 560px; height: 315px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TK1mBqKvIyU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It was a perfect example of a talk being both highly interesting,
compact and
[fun to watch](https://twitter.com/torsteinkrause/status/659441098234966016).

## AB testing

Another great talk was on AB testing by
[Stuart Frisby](https://twitter.com/stuartfrisby). It had lots of
interesting points to take away. Being only a keynote talk, it was not
longer than 15 minutes. Still, the talk managed to cram lots of
interesting context from [booking.com](http://booking.com), humour and
and experience reports into it and you felt you've got an AB boost
after watching it.

When talking about AB testing, we were giving a good starting point:

> Experiment, learn & be open to change

My favourite quote from the talk was:

> Robbed of context, the result of an experiment is a fart in the wind

So true.

## Open source, baby

There was a distinct flair of open source and free software to OSCON,
including in several talks, like in
[Simon Phipps'](https://twitter.com/webmink) keynote talk,
highlighting the importance of GNU, Linux and OSI approved
licenses. In addition to this, his latest message was that
[we have enough foundations, join one of the existing ones](http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-eu-2015/public/schedule/detail/46242)

     class="centered"
/>

I spoke to many fellow coders at the conference and it was quite
common for people to ask me in what open source projects I was
involved and in which ways my company used open source. People at
OSCON had much more awareness of what open source and free software is
than what I am used to.

## Communicating your ideas

My job is back-end development, green text on black all day. Yet,
[Tom Greever](https://twitter.com/tomgreever)'s talk on communicating
UX design was 100% applicable.

I highly recommend everyone to watch this 1 hour talk (it's from a
different confernce, the OSCON talk isn't out yet):

## The physical web

This was a session that presented an interesting concept: that mobile
devices can
[interact with systems around you without knowing anything about those machines](https://github.com/google/physical-web):
Just like REST, the machines tell the devices what they can do and
what the devices need to do to operate the machines.

The example that was used was a mobile phone which paid a parking
machine. This worked because the machine broadcasted the URL which the
device needed to access in order to pay the ticket. Thanks to clever
design, the user experience was that the mobile phone had a native
"parking machine app".

A good quote came up during the talk:

> It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link of the chain of
> destiny can be handled at a time.

â€”Winston Churchill

This was to reflect that there are many problems and criticisms that
come immediately when this
[physical web](https://github.com/google/physical-web) is being
presented. Some slack should be given with the belief that not all
terrible things will come true and good forces will work out hard
problems in time.

## Loads more

I also attended talks on container security, non cryptographic hashing
functions,
[the Seif project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHRXPlq9XNw),
growth hacking, an interesting talk on
[scalability with Kafka](http://www.slideshare.net/jiboumans/keeping-it-realtime),
distributed systems with hadoop, spark, cassandra & kafka,
architecting for failure using a chaos monkey and race conditions in C
code (the latter of which was pretty boring, probably because it was
way over my head, still, I was in awe of the technical expertise of the
guy presenting).

Almost forgot: I attended an interesting talk on scaling MariaDB and
other DBs in the MySQL family

## Go bootcamp

I learned a lot about the Go language in this 3.5 hour boot camp,
going from being a complete noob to creating multi processing channel
consumers and producers. The tutor was
[John Graham-Cumming](https://twitter.com/jgrahamc) who did a fine job
of leading us to a higher state of geekness.

Among the things I learned is that Go UNIXy tooling, allowing
building, auto completion (!), linting, documentation lookup and code
formatting offcially supported, from the command line from day one.

The Emacs support also pretty decent, with on the fly syntax checking
through flycheck. To compliment [go-mode](), I wrote a
[write hook that runs `gofmt` whenever you save the file](https://github.com/skybert/my-little-friends/blob/master/emacs/.emacs.d/tkj-go.el).

Here's a screenshot of my [Emacs](http://emacswiki.org) while
following the lecutre. Top left buffer is the current Go source file,
top right are my lecture notes, bottom left is my compile output and
bottom right is the Go documentation:

       class="centered"
       />
</a>

Fun and interesting as it was, though, I don't see any reason why I'd
pick Go for any project any time soon ðŸ˜ƒ

## Kubernetes & Google Cloud SDK bootcamp

The last input at OSCON came in a workshop about
[The Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) and
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes).

The workshop was extremely fast paced and hands-on, where we started
with nothing and went on to
[setup a full cluster on Google Cloud](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/intro-to-kubernetes-workshop/).

After so may years of only hearing about Amazon AWS, it was refreshing
to try out a new hosting platform and the way we set up Kubernetes and
CoreOS to control Docker machines was cool. It's something that really
excels when your system becomes *BIG*. For my typical work use case
with 10-15 machines, it seemed a bit of an overkill, though.

Still, if I were to start out from scratch creating a new cloud
platform today, the stack presented in this workshop might be a viable
option.


## Yeah!

All in all these three days were a blast. I've learned a lot and
gotten lots inpsiration for future adventures in the world of
geeks. I'll definitely be coming back!

I'll leave you with some of the pictures I snapped while attending
OSCON. Cheers!

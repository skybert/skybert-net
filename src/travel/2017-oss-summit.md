For three days I enjoyed the Open Source Summit conference in
Prague. These are some of the things I learned from attending the
presentations and discussing with presenters and fellow attendees.

## Workflow

> Focus on workflows, not technology.

because it changes. 

Describe how it feels to use the software.

## Keystone
Openstack's identify management and service catalogue. Openstack is a
Python project.

## Python
Python has a
[constraints](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#constraints-files)
file, same as dependency management in Maven. Otherwise, `pip` will
install possibly multiple or wrong versions of transitive dependencies
from `requirements.txt`.

## Data dog
Cannot know where you're going if don't measure what you're doing. We
all are going to crash sometime, no matter how honest you think your
software is.

## Containers

### Kubernetes
A kubernetes pod is two or more containers that share an IP.

The kernel doesn't define what a container is at all. A container,
something that has a pid namespace, needs an init binary. Otherwise
there's no way to spawn or reap processes and reassign their
children. Pid namespaces are hierarchical.

### Rex-ray
Rex-ray container storage.

### Fancy files, containers

> "People end up just using the same shit everywhere"

Same versions of host and container OSes." Because of breakages in
kernel and user land.

## Google Reader

> We all mourn Google Reader
—Novotny 

First spontaneous applaus at OSS summit.  People are messy.

## Bash. 
The `file` command has a magic file in usr share:
```
/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc
```

## Open API, Swagger

Swagger can generate definition from bare JAX-RS. Has JSON schema as
definition format for models.

## Server less
Server less is about not caring about servers. For one off, sporadic
requests. With java, you should make regular requests to keep the jvm
in the lambda container warm. 

### Lambda
Lambda doesn't have versioning of source code. 

Can't access github.com, must upload zip or edit code in online
editor.

### Chalice
[Chalice](https://github.com/aws/chalice), easy creation of
lambdas. Lets you script uploading lambdas → integrate with your local
VC.

### Worth a look
[OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org/),
[openfaas](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) 

## Monitoring
Logs. Good for use known unknowns. New logging platforms like elk and
dagadog are only good for known metrics.

## Buildroot
Makes new stable release every 3 months.

## Licences
[spdx](https://spdx.org/tools), describes licences of source code,
possible to automate license compliance. Test cases in python to test
if a build image will run at all.

[cdla.io](https://cdla.io/), new licences for big data.

### Multi licence projects
Fossology. Not even the kernel is 100% one licence. Think of licences
like an architectural property. GPL readme, remove "or later". SPDX,
tool for automatically check source code.

## Internet of Things - IoT 
Hacking: Internet of threats. Great presentation. Live hack of toy
cars demos.

## People
- Jono: We strive for acceptance. Belonging.

- Status important. 

- Reciprocal species. 

### Habits
Form habits with repetition.

Takes 66 days to develop habits → The first two months extremely
important for new employees.

### Authenticity
No automatic thank you email.

### Code of conduct
> Assholes don't read code of conduct.

### Happiness
It's the intangible world that makes us happy.

### Goals
Set several goals, your own. Not only your mentor's. Embrace the fear,
laugh at your own mistakes.

## Code analysis
`perf` counts various OS metrics. It found that it's much faster to
traverse a bitmap by row instead of by column!

## Chromebook 
- [upspin](https://upspin.io/), storage
- U-root: http://u-root.tk/
- An upcoming über-geekz alternative to Chrome Book,
 [NiChrome](https://github.com/u-root/NiChrome): In a nutshell, this
 is a bare boned OS, running the Linux kernel and most userland
 implemented in Go (except for X, browser, `ssh` and some other
 things).

## Databases
Semi sync replication. At least one slave gets the write. You don't
always want fully synchronous replication.

### Alibaba Cloud
Alibaba cloud. SQL injection alarms. Cheap outside of China.

### Cloud hosted databases like RDS
Many features are disabled as default. Like thread
pools. 

### Cloud locations
Google cloud SQL has a zone in Taiwan.

### DB monitoring
Percona has an open source monitoring tool. Can connect to RDS.

### MariaDB instead of RDS 
Many people run mariadb in ec2 instead of RDS.

### Auto tune database
[Ottertune](https://github.com/cmu-db/ottertune). Auto configure a
database.

## Cloud
Amazon pricing varies between regions.


## File systems
GlusterFS, mounted, but not working. Manually remounting to get
data. High CPU. Fuse driver has a limit on the number of small
operations.  Dependency injection in apps put stress on fs. Negative
caching beneficial on anything dynamic.

### MooseFS
[MooseFS](https://github.com/moosefs/moosefs) looks very
promising. Reliable multi master, meta data and chunk servers, nice
gui, flexible replication per directory.

### BeeGFS
BeeGFS traded performance over consistency.  

### OrangeFS 
OrangeFS very easy to break, no built-in redundancy, adding more nodes
must stop the whole cluster.

### NFS
NFS, very important to cache both hits and misses.  Important to tune
network card kernel settings. As well as IPv4.

## Live patching the kernel
Noop markers replaced. Call redirection.  `cat /proc/cmdline`. Per
thread migration of new kernel. Lazy migration inside methods whose
code never exit for the runtime of the kernel. Atomic replace. Revert
preceding, stacked patches.

## KeyCloak

Talked to RedHat about KeyCloak and the request for adding SCIM
support.

## Open source development

Siemens focus on upstream development both for internal and external
developers. It's otherwise too hard to maintain the systems, because
you in effect have a fork of the software.

## Testing
Testing is the only way to catch all bugs. —Linus. (as opposed to
reading code ). 

## Start coding early
If you were ten or eleven when you started programming, you are
probably a good programmer. It takes a decade to be good at
something. Anything.

##  Kafka
The streaming platform. Real time hadoop, real time analysis of data.

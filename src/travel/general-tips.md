title: My General Travel Tips
tags: travel, china, bangladesh, indonesia

Heya, these are some of my travelling tips. I'm not claiming
to be an expert, but these are some things that have served me
well when travelling in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia
and Bangladesh and I hope that these may be of help to you
too!

## Hands

Your hands are dirty. Let me say that again; <cite>your</cite>
hands are <cite>dirty</cite>. Try to keep them clean, yes, but
always assume they're dirty. As a rule of thumb in this part
of Asia, people's left hand is dirtier than the right, but
after Western standards, they're both dirty.


This means, never eat with your hands. If eating a cookie, use
a napkin around it, use the plastic wrapping etc. When eating
dumplings from your favourite baozi stand on the corner, use
the plastic bag the dumplings come in to hold the bun you're
eating.


In the toilet, use some paper to lift the seat, or use your
foot to kick it open (gently does it).

## Water

Always have water at hand (or <em>in</em> your hand ;-). I
like to always have some in reserve in case I can't get
another bottle at the very second I want/need it. Having a big
bottle (Chinese: <cite>da ping shui</cite>) or two normal ones
(Chinese: <cite>lian ping shui</cite>) makes sense.

## Food

Food's defintely on my top three list when travelling in
Asia. In Taiwan &amp; China (and to the degree you can find
street stalls in Hong Kong), eating from stalls in the street
and in 3m2 big restaurants are the best places to do
so. Always seek out places that are busy, where locals go. If
there's tons of people, it means that the food is made
fresh. If it's made fresh, it's safe to eat as all bacteria
die at 70C. Which leads me to my next rule of thumb, always
eat hot food.


Probably the most dangerous places to eat are slow tourist
restaurants. First of all, the food is not made fresh, but
just as important; there's few/no locals eating there; the
restaurant doesn't need satisfied customers to stay alive as
all the visitors are one/two time guests anyway.


On the contrary, the old woman in the street that makes banana
pancakes from her wee stall has done this 10 hours a day for
the last 20 years. She makes this one dish and makes it
well. That's why locals buy from her every morning at six on
the way to work. And this is why you should feel (pretty) safe
eating her food


In <a href="http://bangladesh.com">Bangladesh</a>, I found
eating from street stalls something to be avoided. Indeed,
even Bangladeshi friends avoid them at times. It's better to
seek out good restaurants where the hygiene is taken (more)
seriously.

## Preparing for diarrhoea &amp; food poisoning

Most people get diarrhoea during the first two - three weeks
when travelling in countries with a very different bacteria
flora than what they're used to.


When/if you get diarrhoea, don't panic. Rememeber, this is
totally normal and something you'll get through within a day
or two. Just put your plans on a hold for a bit, look through
all the photos you've taken so far on the trip, relax and
follow the tips below.


Albeit I've got a good stomach for travelling and seldomly get
diahorrea, I always prepare for it :-) These are some
artifiacts I carry in my rucksack:

<dl>
<dt>
<a
href="http://www.legemiddelverket.no/custom/Preparatsok/prepSearch____80333.aspx?mainSearch=Loperamidhydroklorid&amp;onlyheading=">Loperamidhydroklorid</a>
</dt>
<dd>

Have this with you in case of extreme diahorrea (i.e. if
your shit is like piss) and you need to get on a plane. This
will stop your system.


In Norway, I bought <a
href="http://www.legemiddelverket.no/custom/Preparatsok/prepSearch____80333.aspx?SearchID=b0d90d8b-c0a2-4b09-a87b-9f409c103f11">
Loperamid Mylan</a>

</dd>
<dt>Natrium tablets</dt>
<dd>

Fizz tabletts that you drop into a glass water. This stuff
will give your body some salts it needs to sustain the water
level and keep you from dehydration. Indeed, the most
important thing when you've got diahorrea, is to make sure
you don't dehydrate. Using these kinds of tablets is the
best starting point when getting diahorrea :-)


In Norway, I bought <a
href="http://nestlenutrition.no/healthcare/nb/products/Sider/productDetails.aspx?p=Resorb+V%C3%A6skeerstatning">
Resorb
</a>
and in China I bought <a
href="http://www.smecta.md/index.php?domen_id=67&lang=en&sessia=&username_medicina=">Smecta</a>,
they're basically the same :-)

</dd>
<dt>Flat coke</dt>
<dd>
Drink flat coke, or indeed any mineral water. Mineral water
is better than normal water because they have some salt that
helps your body hold on to the fluids.
</dd>
<dt>Soy sauce</dt>
<dd>
If you don't have anything else, use soy sauce. It has tons
of salts.
</dd>
<dt>What to eat?</dt>
<dd>
White toast without crust, rice, crackers (with salt),
bananas, natural yogurt, chicken soup. Eat little (I eat
like one fourth, one fifth of what I normally do) and
often. The goal is to keep your stomach as small as
possible.
</dd>
<dt>Coal tabletts</dt>
<dd>
Good against food poising. If you've eaten som dodgy food
and quickly get a rising fever for no apparent reason,
chances are you've gotten food poisning. Some people take
coal tablets also if they've got accute diahorrea, although
pharmacists I've spoken to doubt the effect of this.

I've bought this German product called <a
href="http://www.legemiddelverket.no/custom/Preparatsok/prepSearch____80333.aspx?SearchID=ef6e6cc2-afb4-41ef-bbec-a8044b35237f">Kohle
Compretten</a>, but they're many other products out there
that offer the coal tablets.

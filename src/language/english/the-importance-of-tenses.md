In a chat, Lisa asks John if he's seen the new problem in
their computer program.


John's response could mean five different things depending
on what tense he puts on the verb <cite>fix</cite>:


```lisa:``` Have you seen the new bug in our program?


-
```john:``` <cite>Fixing</cite> it (now)

-
```john:``` <cite>Have fixed</cite> it (some time
ago)

-
```john:``` <cite>Fixed</cite> it (can even tell
you <em>when</em> I did it).

-
```john:``` <cite>Will fix</cite> it (soon, later,
sometime)

-
```john:``` <cite>Fix</cite> it (yourself)

If the tenses are wrong, the one you talk or write to
starts guessing what you <em>really</em> meant.


...and that's when the fun starts :-)

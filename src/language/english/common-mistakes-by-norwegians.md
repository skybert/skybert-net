English Words and Expressions Often Causing Problems for Norwegians
(and maybe others too)

## Dress

This might be the most common mistake made by Norwegians: guys
will tell you that they will <cite>take on a dress for their
job interview</cite>. What they mean is of course that they
will <cite>take on their suit</cite>.

The confusing thing, of course, is that <cite>suite</cite> in
Norwegian is <cite>dress</cite>. Whereas <cite>dress</cite> in
Norwegian is <cite>kjole</cite>.

## Priest

"Priests" only exist in the <em>Catholic</em> church. If
you're talking about a <em>Protestant</em> church leader,
'minister' is the word you're looking for.

## First floor

Remember, in English, the first level is called "ground
floor" and the second is called "first floor".

## Mile

In Norwgian, a mile is ten kilotmetres. In English,
however, it's one and a half kilometre!

## God day

Although it's possible to translate "God dag" with "God
day", it may be considered rude (or even awkward) to say so
as a greeting. Just say "hello" instead.

## Congratulations (birthday)

In English, you only say "congratulations" when the person
has <em>accomplished</em>. Although it can be hard to be
alive sometimes, it's hardly considered an accomplishment
to have managed another year. Thus, don't say
"congratulations", use "happy birthday" instead.

## Vs and Ws

<cite>V</cite> and <cite>W</cite> are pronounced the same in
Norwegian. Hence, getting these sounds right when speaking
English is perhaps the greatest problems Norwegians have
pronunciation wise.


So be sure that you're <cite>w</cite>ishes are not
<cite>v</cite>icious. ;-)

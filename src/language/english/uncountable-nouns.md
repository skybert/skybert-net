title: Uncountable Nouns

Watch the uncountable nouns, e.g. no plural of content
(<cite>"the contents of the book"</cite> is different from
<cite>"edit two contents"</cite>, here it should rather be
<cite>"edit two content items"</cite>).

<p>Here are some more "favourite" uncountable noun mistakes:

-
<cite>Will we modify the codes directly</cite>? : Software
source code is <em>always</em> written in singluar:
<cite>code</cite>.

-
<cite>A lot of stuffs</cite> : stuff is <em>never</em>
written in plural
- <cite>Two breads</cite> : bread is <em>never</em> written
in pluar)
-
<cite>Three peoples</cite> : three <cite>peoples</cite> mean
that there are three large ethnic/tribal groups of
people. Normally, you just want to say <cite>people</cite>
in singular.

-
<cite>Logics</cite> : logic is never written in pluarl,
rather use: <cite>A lot of logic</cite>, or <cite>complex
logic</cite>, <cite>much logic</cite>,

You normally have an article in front of the subject and
direct object, the exception being names (of people or
products that everyone knows, e.g. Windows)

<blockquote>

The/A/One <cite>subject</cite> is using the/a/one <cite>direct
object</cite>

</blockquote>

- <cite>The</cite> cat was chasing <cite>two</cite> mice.

- I installed Content Engine on <cite>the</cite> server.

- You were eating <cite>an</cite> apple.

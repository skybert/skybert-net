title: Letter Cases

## Upper Case

All abbreviations should <em>always</em> be upper cased:
<cite>XML</cite>, <cite>REST</cite> and <cite>HTTP</cite>

## Capitalisation

Product names are always capitalised (remember, they're just like
people's names), hence; Community Engine, Struts and Ant.

<p> All table, chapter and section headings are capitalised.
<p> The first letter after a comma (',') is not to be capitalised like
is the case after a period ('.').

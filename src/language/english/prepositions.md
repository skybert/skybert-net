title: Prepositions

Here's some prepositions that a lot of people from Bangladesh
(and probably other places too) get wrong:


-
<cite>In</cite> a section (not <em>on</em> a section)

-
<cite>In</cite> the environment (not <em>on</em> the environment).

-
I've installed the piece of software <cite>on</cite> my
computer (<em>in</em> my computer would mean you've opened
up the computer box and installed the software next to one of
your hard drives!).

-  <cite>On</cite> a (home) page (not <em>in</em> a (home) page)
-
He is <cite>on</cite> support this week (not <em>in</em>
support).

-
<cite>Digging it</cite> means that you like something,
whereas <cite>digging into it</cite> means that you're
investigating the issue further.

-
Remember that it's called <em>at</em> that level (not
<em>in</em> that level).

-
You have experience <cite>with</cite> something (not experince
<em>on</em> something)

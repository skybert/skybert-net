#+title: Using Git as a frontend to Subversion

* Interactive rebase
Normally, you can just use =git rebase -i= to squash/reorder/rewrite
your commits. Using =git-svn=, this doesn't work as your local branch
isn't connected to the repo in the same way.

What I've found to work neatly, is to rebase against the last
previously committed SHA. So first, look in =git log= to find the SHA
of the last commit which has been pushed/pulled to/from Subversion and
use this SHA as an argument to =git rebase=:

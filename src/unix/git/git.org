#+TITLE: Using git

Here are some of my wee =git= notes.

* Publishing a branch
Often, you want to publish the branch you're working on:
#+begin_src text
$ git push -u origin my-great-feature
#+end_src

* Deleting a branch
#+begin_src text
git push origin --delete my-great-feature
#+end_src
* Make a local branch track a remote branch
This is typically what you want when you want to connect your local
branch to the corresponding one on the git server/github:

#+begin_src text
$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/feature/orphan-order-list feature/orphan-order-list
#+end_src

This creates the following stanza in your =.git/config= inside your
project source directory:

#+begin_src conf
[branch "feature/orphan-order-list"]
	remote = origin
	merge = refs/heads/feature/orphan-order-list
	rebase = true
#+end_src

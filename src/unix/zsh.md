I üíò [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), I used it every day
since 1999 üë®‚Äçüéìüë®‚Äçüíª. But [ZSH](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) looks so
nice and after giving it a proper shot, using it for a day in January
2019, I fell in love with it.

## Tab completion with documentation

## Emacs/BASH like navigation

Pressing `M-f` and `M-b` navigates differently than in BASH or in
Emacs, e.g. pressing `M-f` when the cursor (`|`) is on `curl`:

```text
|curl -u admin:admin http://foo-world.com 

```

it jumps to after `-u` instead of after `curl:

```text
curl -u| admin:admin http://foo-world.com
```

To remedy this, I've set this in my `.zshrc`:
```text
autoload -U select-word-style
select-word-style bash
```

Now, I get Emacs/BASH like navigation, hitting `M-f` here:
```
|curl -u admin:admin http://foo-world.com
```

takes me to:
```
curl| -u admin:admin http://foo-world.com
```
just like I wanted too üòÑ

## Forgetting a pipe

```text
$ bash
$ echo hi |
> wc
```

```
$ zsh
$ echo i |
pipe> wc
```

## Forgetting a quote
```text
$ bash
$ echo 'hi
> '
```

```
$ zsh
$ echo 'hi
quote> '
```

## Shows you if command will be found

## Powerful recursive file name matching

## BASH has this too, albeit not enabled by default

```text
$ ls ~/.m2/repository/org/**/*.pom | tail -n 3
ls: cannot access '/home/torstein/.m2/repository/org/**/*.pom': No such file or directory
$ shopt -s globstar
$ ls ~/.m2/repository/org/**/*.pom | tail -n 3
/home/torstein/.m2/repository/org/yaml/snakeyaml/1.15/snakeyaml-1.15.pom
/home/torstein/.m2/repository/org/yaml/snakeyaml/1.17/snakeyaml-1.17.pom
/home/torstein/.m2/repository/org/yaml/snakeyaml/1.18/snakeyaml-1.18.pom
$
```

## Closing a shell where you've started an app

Unlike BASH, you must `disown` the process(es) you've started in the
shell, before closing it:

```text
$ firefox &
$ disown %firefox
$ exit
```

Fortunately, `zsh` gives you auto completion on the jobs to `diswown`,
still it's more cumbersome than `bash` and `dash`.

## Pure prompt

## Async
Fancy prompts with things like git status in them are more snappy than
in `bash`. I suspect this is because ZSH executes those fancy prompt
functions on a separate thread and then decorates your prompt when it
has gotten the data it needs.

## Can re-use BASH aliases
In both my `.bashrc.` and `.zshrc`, I've got this line:
```bash
source $HOME/.bashrc.aliases
```

## Setting up ZSH on Debian
```text
# apt install fzf
# apt install zsh
# apt install zsh-autosuggestions
# apt install zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

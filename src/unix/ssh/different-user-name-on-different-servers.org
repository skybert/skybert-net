#+title: Defining different user names for different servers

Say that locally on your machine, your user is called =jonathan= and
this is also your preferred username on external servers. However, on
some servers, namely all servers in the =example.com= domain plus on
=orange.example.net= you've got the user =john= instead.

Now, you _could_ specify this when logging on these servers using
=ssh john@orange.example.net=. However, if you wish to define this
instead, so that you just can do =ssh orange.example.net=, you can
put the following in your =~/.ssh/config=.

#+begin_src text
Host *.example.com
User john

Host orange.example.net
User john
#+end_src

You can specify many more options. They are all listed in the
ssh_config man page: =man ssh_config=.

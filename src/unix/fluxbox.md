I treasure speed over anything else. I'm lucky to have fast computers
and I want to use their power to do my work faster, not to get nicer
icons. Thus, for work, and often for private use as well, I prefer to
use <a href="http://fluxbox.org">Fluxbox</a> over the heavier desktop
environments with more features and eye candy, such as GNOME and
KDE. Fluxbox stands out from the crowd as it's really lightweight
while at the same time looks good and has support for KDE, GNOME and
Window Maker dock apps. Hence, you can still get your favourite
applets such as the NetworkManager and GNOME power applet in your
system tray, and at the same time use this fast, no nonsense window
manager with a small memory footprint.


On this page, I'll jott down some notes on using this
excellent window manager.

## My keys file

These are the shortcuts that I cannot live without :-) You can

## My startup file

This is the same file that I use when going for the old
school```.xinitrc``` approach and the fluxbox
specific```.fluxbox/startup```. You
can <a href="startup">download my startup file here</a>.




## Getting Chinese Characters displayed everywhere

To get Chinese characters displayed on the Fluxbox window bar,
menu and the slit, I used the following font in my fluxbox
style:


*font: -*-*-*-*-*-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-iso10646-*

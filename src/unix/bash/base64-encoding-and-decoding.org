#+TITLE: Base64 encoding and decoding on the command line

Whenever you want to encode or decode a base64 string, you don't need
to Google around the web for an online website or tool that does it
for you. Most probably, you already have the command =base64=
available as it's a part of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/][GNU core utils]].

What's more, it's really easy to use and since it's a command, you can
pipe its output wherever you want it, e.g. to an XML pretty printer
like =xmllint= if the data is XML or a JSON pretty printer like
=json_pp= if the payload is JSON.

* Encoding
#+begin_src text
$ echo 'hello world' | base64 -
aGVsbG8gd29ybGQK
#+end_src

* Decoding
#+begin_src text
$ echo aGVsbG8gd29ybGQK | base64 -d -
hello world
#+end_src

title: Printing a Date in a Different Timezone

Printing dates, or indeed executing any Unix command for a
certain timezone is easily done with setting the```TZ```
environment variable.


For your local system, you typically set the timezone
in```/etc/timezone```, but often it's useful to change
the timezone just for executing a command or two, such as
priting the date in a different country.


To print the date in e.g. Oslo when your local timezone is
e.g. 'Asia/Taipei', do (yes on the same line, without any
export or the sort):

    $ TZ='Europe/Oslo' date


If you had used an export TZ there, the timezone change would
have "stuck" longer than just the
one```date```.


Another good usecase for setting the```TZ``` variable
is to <a href="../googlecl/">make sure calls to the Google
Calender CLI works.</a>

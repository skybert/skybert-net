Perforce is a great version control system which I've been using at
work since 2005 (well, strictly speaking, I started using it in 2004,
but that was just casual usage). On this page, I'll list some hints on
Perforce, which I tend to forget on how to do. If other folks can find
this scratchpad useful too, that's a bonus :-)

## View the diff of a given change id

    $ p4 describe 35297

## Ask perforce if a certain change has been integrated

    $ p4 integrate -n -b mybranch-2.0 -s @35297,35297

## See pending changelists

    $ p4 changelists -s pending -u myuser

## See all changes within a certain date span

This is how you check all changes in the source tree (from
where you stand) between the first of January 2011 and the
first of February the same year:

    $ p4 changes ...@2011/01/01,2011/02/01

## TAB completion

I've created BASH completion for all p4 commands, you can <a
href="https://raw.github.com/skybert/my-little-friends/master/bash_completion.d/p4">get
the completion file here</a>.

With it in place, you can do:

### Auto completion of commands

    $ p4 c[TAB][TAB]
    change       changelists  client       counter
    changelist   changes      clients      counters

### Auto completion of branches

    $ p4 integrate -b plugins-comm[TAB][TAB]
    plugins-common-1.1     plugins-community-3.1  plugins-community-3.4
    plugins-community      plugins-community-3.2  plugins-community-3.5
    plugins-community-3.0  plugins-community-3.3  plugins-community-3.6

The branch list is cached, in case you were wondering :-) See `~/.p4.d`.

### Auto completion of users

    $ p4 changes -u s[TAB][TAB]
saa      shah     shud     soku     stbe     sym
sai      shaon    sms      sta      support

The user list is cached, in case you were wondering :-) See `~/.p4.d`.

### Auto completion of command specific options

    $ p4 integrate -[TAB][TAB]
    -b   -d   -Ds  -f   -i   -n   -r   -t
    -c   -Di  -Dt  -h   -I   -o   -s   -v

### Auto completion of depot paths

    $ p4 print //depot/[TAB][TAB]
    //depot/BETA      //depot/core      //depot/projects  //depot/tools
    //depot/branches  //depot/escenic   //depot/ps
    //depot/BUILD     //depot/main      //depot/RELEASE

## Coloured diff

```
# apt-get install colordiff
```

Then add the following to your `.bashrc`:
```
export P4DIFF=colordiff
```

Once you've evaluated your `.p4config` or `.bashrc`, you'll get your
diffs in wonderful colours.

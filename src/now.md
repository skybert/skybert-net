This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), updated
2024-01-26 from my home in Norway while the snow is falling down
outside my window.

## Reading
[The Cretan
Runner](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25489204-the-cretan-runner)
by the amazing runner and hero, George Psychoundakis.

## Training
Since it's winter, I go skiing as often as I can, both here in the
nearby forest and in the mountains. Plan to take part in the
[Birkebeiner race in March](https://birkebeiner.no/en/ski).

## Relaxing
In the evening, after the kid sleeps, I thoroughly enjoy playing point
and click adventures on my Steam Deck that I got last summer in
Taiwan.

## Coding
Workwise, I still love working at [Stibo DX](https://stibodx.com),
coding lots of Python, Java, BASH, Linux, OIDC and deal a fair bit
with app security.

## Hacking
Emacs 29.2 with native compilation. Still on Xorg/i3, although I've
started to try out Wayland/Hyprland on my private laptop.

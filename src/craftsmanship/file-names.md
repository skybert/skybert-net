Keep the file names lower case, with hyphens between the words:
```

```
The rationale is as follows:

- Having everything in lower case add security in all situations where
you are to type the file name (referring to the file from a different
source file, HTML++) as you always know the case of all the words.

- Lower case file names are easier on the eyes. When looking at files
for hours on end, having them in lower case easens the strain on the
eyes as:

In stead, consider this file name:

- Lower case is faster to type as you don't have to press shift or
caps lock to get upper case letters.

- Hyphens are easier to type than underscores as you don't have to
press another key to get the character.

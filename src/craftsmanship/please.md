## Add a profile picture

So that we can see who we're chatting to on Slack and who's assigned a
task on the Jira board. Profile pictures makes the digital

## The plural form of PR is PRs

There's no apostrophe in front of plural 's', hence `two PRs`, not
`two PR's`.

It's `two content items`, not `two contents`.

These are the best programming books I've read.

## #1 The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master

Without a doubt the best programming book I've ever read. My only
complaint is that I didn't read it sooner.

## Unix Power Tools

This book is a treasure chest for anyone working with Unix
systems. Linux, OSX, Solaris, IRX, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD users are
all catered for alike. This is a true gem of a book. It's big and
heavy, yet it can be enjoyed in small sips. Just pick it up, flip
through the pages and read 2-3 of them. You'll turn away wiser than
when you opened it!

## Effective Java

If I were to only read one Java book in my life, it should be this
on. This excellent book from Joshua Block focuses on core Java
programming and can be read by any developer, regardless of what
platform or frameworks you're using.

## tl;dr

This is quick guide on giving a talk, meant as a friendly nudge to the
casual presenter. If you just remember one thing after reading this
article, it should be **prepare**: prepare __what you're going to
say__, prepare __how you are going to say__ it and prepare __what the
audience will see__ while you're saying it.

## Prepare

All good presentations are well prepared. If you think you can "just
wing it", don't fool yourself. Your audience will not be fooled.  They
can tell. It takes a lot of practice to make a simple, "casual"
talk. There is no such thing as a simple talk. It all takes
preparation.

Prepare your talk and your slides. Check that your laptop has the
right connector for the projector in the room, that you have your
power supply with you and that the plug fits the one in the
wall. Also, if possible, you should try out the project prior to
making your talk, there's nothing as boring as watching a presenter
fanny about getting the hardware to work. Also, do you need extra
cables? Do you plan on standing or sitting? (will the audience see the
screen if you stand?)

## What you're going to say ðŸ“¢

For a short presentations, say 10-20 minutes, focus on one topic
only. Follow
the [AIDA principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDA_(marketing)):
Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.

**Attention**: get the attention of the audience. A picture, a joke, a
quote.

**Interest**: pique the interest of the audience.  How is your
application different? How does your test framework find bugs faster?

**Desire**: convince the audience that they want your solution, you're
idea. How will it make their life's easier?

**Action**: how can the audience try out your new program? View your
new spreadsheet?


##  Ensure everyone can read your screen ðŸ‘“

Be sure that everyone in the room, also the ones at the back, can read
everything on your screen. It's much better that the size is a little
too big than a little too small.

Choose a lower screen resolution that you're using when you work on
your laptop. If you're unsure which one to choose, for instance if
you've never used the projector before and you don't have time to test
out various resolutions before your talk, use 1024x768. It's a
resolution that all monitors and projectors, no matter the age,
support.

If you know for sure that you'll just show one window for the entire
presentation, increasing the font size of that window might be enough.

For your reference, to increase the font size, you do:

- [PowerPoint](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-keyboard-shortcuts-to-deliver-your-presentation-1524ffce-bd2a-45f4-9a7f-f18b992b93a0#ID0EAACAAA=2016,_2013): <kbd>F5</kbd> (full screen)
- [Keynote](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5986?locale=en_GB)  <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> (full screen)
- Web browser: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>+</kbd>
- Emacs: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> +
  <kbd>+</kbd>
- Start a Linux terminal with a large font: `xterm -fn 10x20`

## Turn off notifications ðŸ’¬

Turn of *all* desktop notifications in all applications you've got
open. Notifications take away the audience's attention to you and what
you are presenting. The notifications popping up during your talk may
even be embarrassing â€” either to you or someone in the audience.

## Slides ðŸ–¼

Most people use a set of slides when giving a talk. That's fine. Here
are a few suggestions for making better slides:

1) Think of your slides as the take off board (you know, the one
gymnasts use when they jump) from which you take off and land.

2) Don't overload them with details. You, the presenter, will
convey the message.

3) Let the slides be just a simple sentence, a number or, even better,
a picture. With slides, less is more. Remove, don't add.

## Final words ðŸ“œ

Since many presenters are not aware of these things, don't take the
time to do them or simply don't bother, you will make __your__ talk
easily above average simply by following these steps.

Remember, everyone in the audience has taken time away from their work
to listen to you. They could all be doing something else, they most
definitely have some work laying around that they feel an urge to
finish. But they chose to listen to you. Therefore, make sure it's
worth their while. 

You make your talk a good one by preparing. Preparing what you are
going to say, prepare how you're going to say it and prepare what the
people in the room will look at while you're saying it.

Now, pick a topic ðŸ’¡, find a stage and talk!  ðŸ“¢

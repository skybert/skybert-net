title: Ciriculum Vitae

I love working with complex Unix and Linux systems comprised of
components such as HTTP servers, app servers, web caches, load
balancers, distributed memory caches, databases, LDAP and application
servers. Making them all play together is a treat :-)

Also, I enjoy designing and developing JEE applications, using web
standards such as XML, CSS, DOM, ECMA/JavaScript as well as hacking on
Python and BASH scripts to glue everything together.

I've been fortunate to work on some of the biggest European web sites
and newspapers, helping the customer with everything from operating
system patching, database, LDAP, web server, cache server, application
server and frontend performance tuning to application development and
development methodology.

Distributed development is something I'm comfortable and have great
experience with. I've worked with multinational teams in several time
zones from January 2007 to January 2014 and am used to the challenges
(and benefits!)  of many nationalities and cultural backgrounds.

Getting teams to function optimally, making everyone feel valued and
boost the team's development velocity is a hugely challenging and
equally rewarding experience that is also the core of my MSc in Human
Resource Management.

Specialities: Multi-server architecture and development of JEE systems
with high demands for performance, availability and scalability.

# Experience
## Conduct AS
### Senior consultant
Conduct AS February 2013 – Present

Building world class solutions for our customers using open source
technologies such as Linux and Java.

I've been (for the most part) fortunate to work with these
technologies: Java backend and frontend development using JBoss, EJBs,
JPA, Apache Wicket, Activiti, Mockito, Hibernate 3 & 4, Spring, Spring
Batch, RESTEasy, memcached, Git, jQuery, jChart, CSS & HTML.

And not so fortunate to work with: ActionScript, Flex, Jaspersoft
iReporter.

Server setup and operations are most of the time a breeze using:
nginx, Apache, RedHat Linux, Ubuntu Linux, BASH, SED, awk & Puppet

## Escenic / Vizrt Online *System architect* Escenic / Vizrt Online
February 2012 – January 2013 (1 year)

I worked in a team of five to build a new SaaS solution for Vizrt
Online's (Escenic's) customers which later will expand to cater for
other systems in Vizrt's portfolio too.

This job was a wonderfully challenging one were I got to work full
time on Linux servers and BASH programming, most of which we release
as open source [github/vizrt/ece-scripts]

This job is fully loaded with exciting challenges including: Varnish,
nginx, lighthttpd, Tomcat, Percona DB, Ubuntu LTS, RHEL, Debian, NFS,
KVM, Amazon WS, Nagios/Icinga, check_mk & Munin. Not to mention
thousands of lines of BASH code, performance testing with httperf &
siege, creation of DEB packges, own APT repositories and build systems
integrating development team efforts with proper release management.

## Escenic / Vizrt Online System architect Escenic / Vizrt Online
November 2008 – January 2012 (3 years 3 months)

As a system architect I was responsible for the general development,
architecture and future technical direction of my two teams' products.

Keeping on top of the latest developments in the domain of social
media APIs, single sign on, captcha APIs, JavaScript APIs, NoSQL
products, HTML5 & CSS, REST, Atom Publishing Protocol, Java frameworks
whilst re-examining the RFCs backing the internet as we know it, made
for a hugely challenging and rewarding experience.

I've got a keen interest in performance tuning, load testing and multi
server architecture and this undoubtedly influenced the specification
I wrote.

The size of my teams varied over the years from 2 in the beginning and
peaking at 10 later on, through which my role changed from being both
architect and tech lead, to acting solely as a system architect (a
year of which it was topped up with a product owner role as well).

During these years, I learned that although caring about general
architecture, deciding how systems talk together, focusing on
interfaces and fundamental principles, communicating technical design
and development approach, I am far more comfortable being a tech lead,
leading the development team by example, working concentrated on
product development with most or all of my commits going into
production rather than into PoCs.

## Escenic Senior consultant
October 2005 – November 2008 (3 years 2 months)

I worked with some of the biggest newspapers in Europe, helping them
on-site primarily with production environments: Unix, Linux, DBs,
LDAP, distributed memory caches, reverse proxies, load balancers,
deployment routines, development methodology, web site development and
editorial workflow.

I've found it challenging and hugely interesting to work different
parts of the newspaper organisations: From both editorial staff,
designers and business management to development departments and
hosting partners: Finding the correct solution for the customer that
serves the needs of all parties' area of interest has been a rewarding
experience.

## CoreMedia AG Technical Consultant
2004 – 2005 (1 year)

Working on one Europe's biggest web portals with hefty JEE
development on a Solaris platform with extreme demands for high
performance.

This year taught me a lot about working for extremely structured,
quality conscious and demanding customers; never settling for anything
but the best.

## Splendid Internet GmbH & Co. KG Developer
2003 – 2004 (1 year)

I'm very grateful for this job as it taught me a lot of the German
work ethics, of extreme attention to detail and structured approach to
development.

Working as a developer on a project for one of the biggest German
telecoms allowed me to work with JEE, SOAP web services, CORBA,
GNU/Linux and HP-Unix - all in the same solution!

2001 – 2002 (1 year)

Summer intern & part time work involving ECMA/JavaScript, DOM and
Python development as well as testing Opera on the Linux platform.

# Volunteering
## Icntys International / KIA
August 2006 -> Present

Once a week for many years now, I have worked as a volunteer teacher
teaching Norwegian to immigrants from all over the world.

During these years, I have had great fun teaching at all levels, from
the students who do not speak a word of Norwegian, to the ones who
have need to polish and further improve their already well functioning
language.

Arranging social events around the language...more Projects

Escenic Tip Engine is a Java application that enables media companies
to gather information from ordinary citizens through Email, SMS or
MMS. I contributed to the client part of the application, which was
developed using Java Swing. During this project, I attended a
two-month training session in Oslo, Norway.

This presenter at [Computerphile](http://youtube.com/user/Computerphile),
he's absolutely brilliant. It's rare to find someone so technical in
computer science being so good at presenting.

[Flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask): Impressed with what I've
read and tried out so far. In less than 20 lines of code, I've a
standalone micro service Python application which routes different
HTTP URLs to internal methods, reads user input and outputs JSON
objects.

From the (first hour) look at it, it seems that Flask strikes just the
right balance between simplicity and bare bones Python on the one hand
and support for real world world features like security, complex
objects, templating, database integration, application types, error
handling, logging and easy deployment on the other.

I've read about these
[free HTML grids before,](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/07/type-grids-free-template/)
but I didn't check them out to see how simple and beautiful they were
before now.

[Idle highlight](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/IdleHighlight)
mode gives you IDEA/Eclipse-like highlighting of other uses of the
variable/method under your cursor. It only triggers after a slight
delay, which is excellent.

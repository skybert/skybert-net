### Firefox

#### Navigate to the previous tab

Just like <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> on your desktop, just use
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+ <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate to the previous tab you
were at.

Except that it doesn't work the way you expect it to. It only cycles
between the tabs.

Enter the "Firefox registry" by writing `about:config` in the address
bar. Then navigate to this key and set it to `true`:
```
browser.ctrlTab.previews
```


#### Quckly find any tab

<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>e</kbd>

And type something matching that tab's title.

Adobe has a really nice font called Source Code Pro, to start Emacs
with this found, you can do:

[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) a JS framework with persistent
storage and automatic syncing of all clients' and server's
storage. From never having heard about it, to having a working multi
user chat system up and running, it took 30 minutes.

A hidden gem in the <a href="http://fluxbox.org">Fluxbox</a> window
manager is the client menu which gives you a list of all the open
windows on all workspaces. I've bound it to `Ctrl + Shift + y` like
this in my `~/.fluxbox/keys`:

    Control Shift y         :ClientMenu

Finding it was indeed a great discovery and I've happily used it for a
couple of years now. This week, I discovered something equally useful:
You can navigate the client menu (window list) by simply typing the
first letters of its title.

Here, I've types "emacs" to navigate to the Emacs window.

Discovered that the more I read about character sets and character
encodings, the more I know that I don't know. Nevertheless, I've
learned a **LOT** while preparing for my
[JavaZone](http://javazone.no) talk:

MySQL's `utf8` encoding type on columns and tables isn't proper UTF-8,
it only supports up to 3 byte characters, not 4 bytes as UTF-8 can grow
to.

To be able to insert the whole spectre of Unicode that UTF-8 supports,
you must set up your MySQL database to use the encoding type called
`utf8mb4`.

A good article [on the topic can be found here](
https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4)

Running `occur` in [Emacs](http://gnu.org/software/emacs) gives you
nice listing of all lines in the current file with an occurances of
your search query. Here, I search for all lines containing
```db.get```:

<img
  src="../../graphics/2015/emacs-occur.png"
  alt="emacs occur"
/>

The hits are both clickable and iteratable with the standard
```next-error``` mechansim (by default bound to ``` C-` ```).

This excellent article at W3C explains [how to center things on a web
page (including images) using the standards](http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html#block),
i.e. by **not** using ```<center/>```.

You cannot create files directories on Windows starting with a dot and
no suffix. Try this: create a directory in Windows Explorer
called ".ssh".

Windows will not only fail to do this, but ask you to enter a file
name as if you hadn't written anything at all.

Apparantly this is
[something inherited from the days of old](http://superuser.com/questions/64471/create-rename-a-file-folder-that-begins-with-a-dot-in-windows#comment66479_64471),
i.e. Windows' DOS heritage.

Ugly looking capitalised  music, pictures, documents directories
begone! I prefer to have all my directories and files lower case. It's
easier on my eyes and it reads faster. Thus, I've hated how GNOME and
others enforced a pile of directories with names like "Documents" and
"Music" on me. Deleting them was no good as some kept coming back and
my actual music and document directories didn't get the icon
decoration that their capitalised counterparts got.

As you can understand, I was thrilled when I discovered today that
sanity was a mere text edit away (I thought so!):

    $ vim ~/.config/user-dirs.dir

And then set these to my preferred directories:
```
XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/"
XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR="$HOME/tmp"
XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR="$HOME/tmp"
XDG_PUBLICSHARE_DIR="$HOME/tmp"
XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR="$HOME/doc"
XDG_MUSIC_DIR="$HOME/music"
XDG_PICTURES_DIR="$HOME/pictures"
XDG_VIDEOS_DIR="$HOME/videos"
```

Logging out and in again in GNOME gave immediate success. The file
manager even had my "pictures" and "music" and "tmp" directories
nicely decorated with meta icons.

[puppet-lint](http://puppet-lint.com/) will not only spot errors and
deviations from Puppet Lab's best practices, it will also fix many of
these issues for you:

``` $ puppet-lint --fix init.pp ```

When using [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed), you can use
much more powerful regular expressions by passing the
```--regexp-extended``` switch to ```sed```.

Passing ```--regexp-extended```, or just ```-r```, also makes some of
the syntax easier as you don't have to escape group parenthesis and I
find ```sed``` overall becomes more predictable using this switch.

It's easy writing presentation slides using Markdown and generate
these into beautiful HTML5 slides with CSS3 transitions from
[reval.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/)  by using
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html)

Previously, I've been using an exporter to Emacs org, but ```pandoc```
is so much more stable and flexible.

[PlantUML](https://yar.fruct.org/projects/plantuml-deb) is a great
command for generating diagrams from plain text files. It also sports
a Confluence plugin - among other things.

This presenter at [Computerphile](http://youtube.com/user/Computerphile),
he's absolutely brilliant. It's rare to find someone so technical in
computer science being so good at presenting.

[Flask](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask): Impressed with what I've
read and tried out so far. In less than 20 lines of code, I've a
standalone micro service Python application which routes different
HTTP URLs to internal methods, reads user input and outputs JSON
objects.

From the (first hour) look at it, it seems that Flask strikes just the
right balance between simplicity and bare bones Python on the one hand
and support for real world world features like security, complex
objects, templating, database integration, application types, error
handling, logging and easy deployment on the other.

I've read about these
[free HTML grids before,](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/07/type-grids-free-template/)
but I didn't check them out to see how simple and beautiful they were
before now.

[Idle highlight](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/IdleHighlight)
mode gives you IDEA/Eclipse-like highlighting of other uses of the
variable/method under your cursor. It only triggers after a slight
delay, which is excellent.

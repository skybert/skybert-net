The famous spelling mistake in the HTTP/1.0 specification, `Referer`
instead of `Referrer` is blamed on the UNIX spell checker not having
neither of them in its dictionary at the time they wrote the
RFC. Check out this nugget from 1995:

Servers can run out of entropy (randomness needed to complete various
tasks such as JAR signing, SSL connections), one way to mitigate this
is to install `haveged`:

#### Containers
Docker provides a great developer experience but it leaves many things
to be decided when it comes to taking it into production:

Really interesting to see what's moving in the container world. RedHat
is really shaking things up in the Docker world:

Interesting read on containers and challenges of sharing a kernel in
spite of namespace & cgroups:

#### Reverse proxies 

Finally got around to upgrade from Varnish 3 to 4. The folks at
Varnish Software have been so nice to provide an upgrade guide which,
albeit not a complete guide, is a good starting point:

nginx can do TCP load balancing now, making it an alternative to
HAProxy in my setup:

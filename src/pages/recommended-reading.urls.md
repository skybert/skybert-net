The famous spelling mistake in the HTTP/1.0 specification, `Referer`
instead of `Referrer` is blamed on the UNIX spell checker not having
neither of them in its dictionary at the time they wrote the
RFC. Check out this nugget from 1995:

#### Reverse proxies 

Finally got around to upgrade from Varnish 3 to 4. The folks at

albeit not a complete guide, is a good starting point:

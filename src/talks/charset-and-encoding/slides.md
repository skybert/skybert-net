## Goals for this talk

> Know

- What a character set is
- What an encoding is
- Differentiate encoding problems from display problems
- Debunk 2 myths

---

You'll get a <h1>Quiz</h1> at the end, so pay attention!

---

## Crash course
### Character sets and encodings

---

## ASCII

>  American Standard Code for Information Interchange

<img src="usa-uk.jpg" alt="usa &amp; uk"/>

---

## ASCII

- An absolute genius of a standard
- ...as long as you speak English

---

## ASCII - for nerds

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character</th>
    <th>Decimal</th>
    <th>Decimal</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td><td>65</td><td>1 0 0 0 0 0 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td><td>66</td><td>1 0 0 0 0 1 0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

- One character corresponds to one numeric value
- 7 bit

---

## ASCII - for nerds

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character</th><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a</td><td>97</td><td>1 1 0 0 0 0 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>b</td><td>98</td><td>1 1 0 0 0 1 0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

> Value for upper case letter + 32 = value for the lower case letter.
> Brilliant!

## Then came the Europeans

---

Need for new characters that didn't exist

---

## The hostel was full

- All the 127 rooms were taken
- ...so they added another zero

> ‚Üí **0** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

---

## 256 characters, hurrah!

---

## Then came the Asians

<img src="dragon.png" alt="Dragon"/>

> ‰Ω†Â•ΩÂóéÔºü

---

## A whole lot of nonsense

- Many made their own character sets
- Incompatibility all around

---

## Finally peace: Unicode

- Caters for all characters and letters in all dead and spoken
  languages (has today more than 110 000 characters)
- And more room to spare if other languages decide to drop by

---

## Unicode is a character set

A table with entries for all letters and character in the entire
world.

---

## Each entry has
<ul>
<li class="fragment">A numeric value (code points)</li>
<li class="fragment">A name</li>
</ul>

---

## Unicode examples

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character</th>
    <th>Code point</th>
    <th>Name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Œ©</td>
    <td>937</td>
    <td>GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="fragment">
    <td>√Ö</td>
    <td>197</td>
    <td>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## How to find the Unicode value

Also known as the **code point** of a character.

For instance "~" (tilde)?

---

## Java

    String c = "~";
    int unicodeCodepoint = (int) c.charAt(0);

---

## Java

    String s = "üêò";
    int unicodeCodepoint =  Character.codePointAt(s, 0);

---


## JavaScript

    var c = "~";
    var unicodeCodepoint = c.codePointAt(0);

----

## Emacs


    M-x describe-char

---

## Emacs

```
             position: 25 of 26 (92%), column: 24
            character: ~ (displayed as ~) (codepoint 126, #o176, #x7e)
    preferred charset: ascii (ASCII (ISO646 IRV))
code point in charset: 0x7E
               script: latin
               syntax: _    which means: symbol
             category: .:Base, a:ASCII, l:Latin
             to input: type "C-x 8 RET 7e" or "C-x 8 RET TILDE"
          buffer code: #x7E
            file code: #x7E (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix)
              display: by this font (glyph code)
    xft:-unknown-DejaVu Sans Mono-normal-normal-normal-*-22-*-*-*-m-0-iso10646-1 (#x61)

Character code properties: customize what to show
  name: TILDE
```

## UTF-8

<ul>
  <li>Has conquered the world</li>
  <li class="fragment">ASCII compatible</li>
  <li class="fragment">
    Invented by Ken Thompson in 1992 while he was having dinner in a restaurant
  </li>
  <li class="fragment">
    A standard so simple you can explain it on a napkin
  </li>
</ul>

---

## Killer features

1. All ASCII strings are valid UTF-8; An ASCII
string encoded in UTF-8 has **0** as the first bit.

2. Easy to navigate and find current, previous and next character.

---

## UTF-8 - for nerds

- Unicode characters can use up to **4** bytes (the digits are the
  header fields, the **x**s can be used for actual values):

```
11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
```

---

## The difference between Unicode and UTF-8

- Unicode is a table with numeric values and names for all characters
in the whole wide world.

- UTF-8 is of several ways to encode a Unicode numeric value to
  bytes.

---

## Why is this important?

Consider this:

- UTF-8 : ASCII compatible
- UTF-16 : **not** ASCII compatible (Windows & Java)
- UTF-32 : **not** ASCII compatible

---

## Character set & encoding in Java, HTML, HTTP & friends

---

## Java

[Java's internal representation of strings is Unicode](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/overview.html)
(with UTF-16 encoding)

    final String name = getNameFromFacebook(id);

---

## Resource bundles

- [Java resource bundles must be encoded in ISO-8859-1](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html).

- Characters that don't fit into ISO-8859-1 must therefore be
  represented using Unicode escape notation:

```
native2ascii -encoding utf8 resources.utf8 resources.properties
```

- Or, it is still possible to write UTF-8 into your .properties if you
on the Java side do:
```
return new String(val.getBytes("ISO-8859-1"), "UTF-8");
```

---

## Flex & ActionScript

- [Default encoding in Flex](https://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flex/1/internationalization_flex_short/internationalization_flex_short9.html)
is UTF-8.

- You can override this in the MXML file:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>
```

- Or your editor can specify the encoding when it writes the file to
disk, burning a mark in it using a so called BOM

---

## Did you say BOM?

- BOM is something that we can use if cannot write the encoding into
the file's contents.

- For instance when we when write a plain text file

- An example of a [UTF-8 encoded file without BOM](hello-without-bom.txt)

- An example of a [UTF-8 encoded file with BOM](hello-with-bom.txt)

---

## XML

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

- The [XML specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charencoding)
dictates that the standard encoding to be
[UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)

- All XML parsers must as a minimum support UTF-8

---

## HTTP

When we surf on [facebook.com](http://facebook.com) or write Java code
that consume REST, RPC over HTTP and SOAP services, the server says
with which encoding the contents is serialised:

    $ GET http://vg.no
    ..
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

<img src="facebook.png" alt="facebook"/>

---

## HTML

Inside the HTML file itself, it's also important that the encoding
is correct so that the contents is _displayed_ properly in the web
browser:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>

---

## Runtime environment

In addition to how the data are stored and serialised it's also
important that we take care of things on our side:

‚Üí Fonts

---

## Runtime environment

> for nerds

---

### JVM parameters

```
-Dsun.jnu.encoding=utf-8
-Dfile.encoding=utf-8
```

---

### JDBC connection string

    jdbc:jtds:sybase://db01:4100/mydb?characterEncoding=utf8

---

### UNIX locale

```
$ locale -a | grep en_GB.utf8
$ export LC_ALL=en_GB.utf8
$ export LANG=en_GB.utf8
```

---

## Myth #1

> The encoding of the Java file decides how the data that are written
> by this Java component is written to the database.

---

## Myth #1 busted

The file encoding only decides how the characters in the Java file
itself are stored and displayed:
```
/**
 * @author S√∏ren Westerg√•rd
 */
 final static String PRODUKT = "UF√ò";
```

----

## Myth #1 busted

Data encoding, on the other hand, decides how the _data_ (which the
Java program writes or reads) are read and written:

```
database.writeData(data, Encoding.UTF-8);
```

---

## Myth #2

> The encoding inside system X affects the data it sends out and how
> our system saves these data in our system.

---

## Myth #2 busted

It's irrelevant that system X stores its data internally as
[Windows 1252](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) as long as
the web services through which it exposes these data returns XML
encoded as [UTF-8](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

---

## The database

- Many databases in Europe used (and several still use!)
  [ISO-8859-1](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1) encoding.
- If someone attempts to write a character into these databases that's
  not covered by
  [ISO-8859-1](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1), for instance "*‚Äì*"
  [Unicode EN DASH](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)
  (hyphen), the database will throw an error up to the web application.

## MySQL users beware

What's wrong with this statement?

```
mysql> create database mydb
       character set utf8
       collate utf8_general_ci;
```

---

## MySQL utf8

The MySQL `utf8` table/column encoding is not real UTF-8

---

## MySQL utf8

Only 1-3 byte characters supported.

---

## MySQL utf8

For full UTF-8 support, use the `utf8mb4` type instead.

---

## MySQL utf8mb4

This will fix obscure errors like:

---

## When you thought you were done

---

## Once your full stack is Unicode friendly

---

## Collation may still haunt you üëª

---

## H√¶?

---

## Default collation in MySQL

- Is Swedish Latin 1

---

## Quiz

---

## Unicode is ....

1. An encoding
2. A character set

---

## UTF-8 is ....

1. An encoding
2. A character set

---

## Can you save "Alfa and Œ©"

> in a database with ISO 8859-1 encoding?

1. Yes
2. No

---

## If you see big squares

> instead of letters, it's because ...

1. The data are saved using one encoding and are displayed with another
2. The character set used when saving the data didn't have support for
   the letter(s)
2. The font you're using is missing the letter(s)

---

## If my Java source file uses Windows 1252 encoding

> will √¶, √∏ and √• be written correctly to the database?

1. Yes
2. No
3. That depends on how the DB and the JDBC connection are set up

---

## What has happened here?

> Kj√É¬∏rer

1. You're missing a font to show the letter after "Kj".
2. Mismatch between the encoding used when saving the data and reading
   them.

---

## Summary

> for everyone

- If you're seeing **squares** it's because the font your program is
  using doesn't have support for the letter (but _everything is ok
  with the system_).

- If you're seeing complete nonsense like **Kj√É¬∏rer** it's because
  something has gone wrong with the encoding one or more places in the
  system you're using.

---

## Summary

> for everyone - II

- Which character sets and encoding third party systems are using
  internally is irrelevant.

- What matters is how the data is _transported_ between the systems.

---

## Summary

> for nerds

- Character set and encoding are not the same (at least since 1992)
- Unicode and UTF-8 are not the same
- Use [UTF-8](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding everywhere:
  file encoding, data encoding, JDBC connection strings, UNIX locales.

---

## Summary

> for the impatient

- Use UTF-8 everywhere

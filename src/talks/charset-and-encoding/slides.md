2. No

---

## If you see big squares

> instead of letters, it's because ...

1. Encoding problem

1. It depends
2. Yes
3. No

---

## What has happened?

# Part I

Crash course in

### Character sets & encodings

---

## ASCII

>  American Standard Code for Information Interchange

<img src="usa-uk.jpg" alt="usa &amp; uk"/>

---

## ASCII

<ul>
  <li>An absolute genius of a standard</li>
  <li class="fragment">...as long as you speak English</li>
</ul>

---

## ASCII

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character</th>
    <th>Decimal</th>
    <th>Binary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td><td>65</td><td>1 0 0 0 0 0 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td><td>66</td><td>1 0 0 0 0 1 0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

- One character corresponds to one numeric value
- 7 bit

---

## ASCII

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character</th><th>Decimal</th><th>Binary</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a</td><td>97</td><td>1 1 0 0 0 0 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>b</td><td>98</td><td>1 1 0 0 0 1 0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

> Value for upper case letter + 32 = value for the lower case letter.
> Brilliant!

---

## Then came the Europeans

<img src="columbus.jpg" alt="Columbus" style="height: 400px"/>

---

Need for new characters that didn't exist

---

## No room in the inn

- All the 127 rooms were taken
- ...so they added another zero

> ‚Üí **0** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1

---

## 256 characters, hurrah!

---

## Europeans could now enter the computer age

---

Endless <h2>possibilities</h2> with 8 bits:

- Code pages
- ISO-8859-*

---

## Then came the Asians

<img src="dragon.png" alt="Dragon"/>

> ‰Ω†Â•ΩÂóéÔºü

---

## A whole lot of nonsense ‚ò†

- Many made their own character sets
- Incompatibility all around

---

## Finally peace
## ‚òÆ

---

## Unicode

---

## Unicode

- Caters for all characters and letters in all dead and spoken languages
- Has today more than 110 000 characters
- And plenty of room to spare

---

Unicode is a

## Character set

---

## Character set

> A defined list of characters recognized by the computer hardware and
> software. Each character is represented by a number.

[webopedia.com](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/character_set.html)

---

## Each entry has
<ul>
<li class="fragment">A numeric value (code point)</li>
<li class="fragment">A name</li>
</ul>

---

## Unicode examples

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Character</th>
    <th>Code point</th>
    <th>Name</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Œ©</td>
    <td>937</td>
    <td>GREEK CAPITAL LETTER OMEGA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="fragment">
    <td>√Ö</td>
    <td>197</td>
    <td>LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## How to find the Unicode value

Also known as the **code point** of a character.

For instance "~" (tilde)?

---

## Java

    String c = "~";
    int unicodeCodepoint = (int) c.charAt(0);

---

## Java üêò

    String s = "üêò";
    int unicodeCodepoint =  Character.codePointAt(s, 0);

---


## JavaScript

    var c = "~";
    var unicodeCodepoint = c.codePointAt(0);

----

## Wikipedia

---

## Emacs

    M-x describe-char

---

## Emacs

```
             position: 25 of 26 (92%), column: 24
            character: ~ (displayed as ~) (codepoint 126, #o176, #x7e)
    preferred charset: ascii (ASCII (ISO646 IRV))
code point in charset: 0x7E
               script: latin
               syntax: _    which means: symbol
             category: .:Base, a:ASCII, l:Latin
             to input: type "C-x 8 RET 7e" or "C-x 8 RET TILDE"
          buffer code: #x7E
            file code: #x7E (encoded by coding system utf-8-unix)
              display: by this font (glyph code)

```

---

## RTFM

Only a few key presses away on any Unix:

```
$ man ascii
$ man charset
$ man unicode
$ man utf-8
$ man iconv
```

---

### So what's UTF-8 then?

---

UTF-8 is a character <h2>encoding</h2>

---

## Character encoding

> ... a character encoding is used to represent a repertoire of
> characters by some kind of an encoding system

[wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding)

---

## UTF-8

<ul>
  <li class="fragment">ASCII compatible</li>
  <li class="fragment">
    A standard so simple you can explain it on a napkin
  </li>
</ul>

---

## Who is this?

[linuxbeard.com](http://linuxbeard.com/post/6855753580/ken-thompson-and-dennis-ritchie-were-researchers)

---

## Created over a meal

- Ken Thompson & Rob Pike went for dinner, September 1992.
- UTF-8 was invented by Ken Thompson
- Wrote it down on a placemat

---

## Killer features

1. All ASCII strings are valid UTF-8
2. An ASCII string encoded in UTF-8 has **0** as the first bit.
3. Easy to navigate and find current, previous and next character.
4. Never eight 0s in a row

---

## UTF-8 - 1 byte

```
                                   0xxxxxxx
```

---

## UTF-8 - 2 bytes

```
                          110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                   0xxxxxxx
```
---

## UTF-8 - 3 bytes

```
                 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                          110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                   0xxxxxxx
```

---

## UTF-8 - 4 bytes

```
       11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
                         110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
                                  0xxxxxxx
```

---

## The difference between Unicode and UTF-8

- Unicode is a table with numeric values and names for all characters
in the whole wide world.

- UTF-8 is one of several ways to encode a Unicode numeric value to
  bytes.

---

## Why is this important?

- UTF-8 : ASCII compatible
- UTF-16 : **not** ASCII compatible (Windows & Java)
- UTF-32 : **not** ASCII compatible

---

# Part II
### Character encoding in Java
HTML, HTTP & friends

---

## Java

Java's
[internal representation of strings ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/overview.html)
is UTF-16.

    final String name = getNameFromFacebook(id);

---

## Specify the encoding whenever you can

---

## Resource bundles

- Java resource bundles
  [must be encoded in ISO-8859-1](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/PropertyResourceBundle.html).

- Characters that don't fit into ISO-8859-1 must therefore be
  represented using Unicode escape notation:

```
$ native2ascii -encoding utf8 ghost-text-utf8 ghost-text.properties
```

---

## A ghostly example üëª

```
$ cat ghost-text-utf8
ghost_title=This is a üëª

$ native2ascii -encoding utf8 ghost-text-utf8
ghost_title=This is a \ud83d\udc7b
```

---

Before you <h2>fall in loveüíò</h2>
with the Unicode escapes

---

## cons

- The escapes are translated before the code is compiled
- Harmless comments become hidden backdoors
- Or just break the build üí£


---

## Resource bundles

- Possible to use UTF-8 in your `.properties` files if you do:

```
public String getPropertyFromUTF8File(final String pKey)
  throws IOException {

  ResourceBundle bundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle(
    "ghost-text-utf8", Locale.ENGLISH);
  String value = bundle.getString(pKey);
  return new String(value.getBytes("ISO-8859-1"), "UTF-8");
}
```

---

## Can you trust String#length()?

```
@Test
public void ghostIsOneCodeUnit() {
  final String ghost = "üëª";
  assertEquals("ghost is just one character", 1, ghost.length());
}
```

---

## Can you trust String#length()?

```
@Test
public void ghostIsOneCodeUnit() {
  final String ghost = "üëª";
  assertEquals("ghost is just one character", 1, ghost.length());
}
```

```
Failed tests: ghostIsOneCodeUnit(GhostLengthFailingTest):
  ghost is just one character expected:<1> but was:<4>
```
---

## A safer bet

Use
[String#codePointCount(from, to)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#codePointCount(int,%20int)):

```
@Test
public void ghostIsOneCodePoint() {
  final String ghost = "üëª";
  assertEquals(
    "ghost is just one character",
    1,
    ghost.codePointCount(0, ghost.length())
  );
}
```

---

## Text rendering control

Number of visible glyphs on the screen:

```
BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance();
```


---

## Maven

> Ever seen this one?

```
[WARNING] File encoding has not been set, using platform encoding
          UTF-8, i.e. build is platform dependent!

```

----

## Make your builds safe

```
<properties>
  <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
</properties>
```

---

## You can now use UTF-8 in your source files

A ‚ô• looks so much better than `\u2665`

---

## XML & JSON

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

- The [XML specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charencoding)
dictates that the standard encoding to be
[UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
- All XML parsers must as a minimum support UTF-8
- JSON [must be encoded](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt) in a
  Unicode encoding, UTF-8 is default

---

## Encoding in ANY file?

Your editor can specify the encoding when it writes the file to disk,
burning a mark in it using a so called BOM.

---

## Did you say BOM?

---

## BOM

- Is something that we can use if cannot write the encoding into
the file's contents.
- For instance when we when write a plain text file.

---

## BOM

An example of a
[UTF-8 encoded file without BOM](hello-without-bom.txt)


<img src="hello-without-bom.png" alt="without bom"/>

---

## BOM

An example of a [UTF-8 encoded file with BOM](hello-with-bom.txt)

<img src="hello-with-bom.png" alt="without bom"/>

---

## BOM - beware

> if you're counting bytes

- Some encodings automatically add a BOM
- UTF-16 adds a two byte BOM

---

## HTTP

When we surf on [facebook.com](http://facebook.com) or write Java code
that consume REST, RPC over HTTP and SOAP services, the server says
which encoding the contents are serialised with:

    $ GET http://vg.no
    ..
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

---

# Wait!

> Why does it say charset?

---

## MIME is to blame

---

## MIME is to blame

- MIME, [RFC 2045, May 1996](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045),
  used the term "charset"
- HTTP 1.0, [RFC 1945, May 1996](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945),
  included MIME.

---

## HTTP

- HTTP wanted to keep the terminology consistent, but acknowledges:

> Note: This use of the term "character set" is more commonly referred
> to as a "character encoding." However, since HTTP and MIME share the
> same registry, it is important that the terminology also be shared.

---

## HTML

Inside the HTML file itself, it's also important that the encoding
is correct so that the contents is _displayed_ properly in the web
browser:

    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>

---

## Runtime environment

In addition to how the data are stored and serialised it's also
important that we take care of things on our side:

> ‚Üí Fonts

---

### JVM parameters

```
-Dsun.jnu.encoding=utf-8
-Dfile.encoding=utf-8
```

---

### JDBC connection string

    jdbc:jtds:sybase://db01:4100/mydb?characterEncoding=utf8
    jdbc:mysql://db01:3306/mydb?autoReconnect=true&amp;\
                                useUnicode=true&amp;\
                                characterEncoding=UTF-8&amp;\
                                characterSetResults=UTF-8

---

### UNIX locale

```
$ locale -a | grep en_GB.utf8
$ export LC_ALL=en_GB.utf8
$ export LANG=en_GB.utf8
```

---

## Myth #1

> The encoding of the Java file decides how the data that are written
> by this Java component are written to the database.

---

## Myth #1 busted

The file encoding only decides how the characters in the Java file
itself are stored and displayed:
```
/**
 * @author S√∏ren Westerg√•rd
 */
 final static String PRODUKT = "UF√ò";
```

----

## Myth #1 busted

Data encoding, on the other hand, decides how the _data_ (which the
Java program writes or reads) are read and written:

```
new OutputStreamWriter(out, "UTF-8");
```

---

## Myth #2

> The encoding inside system X affects the data it sends out and how
> our system saves these data in our system.

---

## Myth #2 busted

It's irrelevant that system X stores its data internally as
[Windows 1252](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) as long as
the web services through which it exposes these data returns XML
encoded as [UTF-8](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8).

---

# Part III

<h3> The database</h3>

---

## The database

<ul>
  <li>
    Many databases in Europe used (and several still use!)
    [ISO-8859-1](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1) encoding.
  </li>
  <li class="fragment">
    If someone attempts to write a character into these databases that's
    not covered by
    [ISO-8859-1](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1), for instance "*‚Äì*"
    [Unicode EN DASH](http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode)
  (hyphen)...
  </li>
  <li class="fragment">
    the database will throw an <span class="fragment highlight-red">error</span> up to the
    web application.
  </li>
</ul>

---

## MySQL users beware

What's wrong with this statement?

```
mysql> create database mydb
       character set utf8
       collate utf8_general_ci;
```

---

## MySQL utf8

The MySQL `utf8` table & column encoding is not real UTF-8

---

## MySQL utf8

Only 1-3 byte characters supported.

---

## MySQL utf8mb4

For full UTF-8 support, use the `utf8mb4` type instead.

---

## MySQL utf8mb4

This will fix obscure errors like:

# My requirements
- Zero conf: Easily setup a new Java project
- Fast: must handle large projects
- Large meaning ~7000 classes (Tomcat has 2200)
- Easy to switch between projects

# Seeing is believing

Will use a wee app,
[cheese-shop](git@gitlab.com:skybert/cheese-shop.git) to show the
Java features in Emacs.  

---

# Seeing is believing

- Auto completion
- Code navigation
- Jump to source of 3rd party libraries
- Import classes
- Static import methods and fields
- Run JUnit tests from within Emacs

---

# Seeing is believing
- Linting
- Unused variables
- Wrong syntax
- Missing generics

---

# Seeing is believing
- Implement missing class
- Implement missing method

---

# Seeing is believing
- Debug application from within Emacs
- Debugger with conditional break points

---

# Seeing is believing
- Refactoring: rename variable
- Refactoring: extract to variable
- Refactoring: extract to method

---

# System.exit(0);

## Alienation

> “Alienation is where the individual feels that work is a necessity
> imposed upon him or her.  Working under such conditions means
> abandoning one's control over doing the job or of developing it”

—Rosenfeld & Wilson

---

## Motivation

> “Motivation is where the individual feels that work is sometimes
> good and sometimes bad, but that it is fulfilling, stasifying and
> capable of development in all ways”

—Rosenfeld & Wilson

> cannot expect increasing levels of motivation from their staff”

> merely prevents dissatisfaction (called hygiene factors)”
